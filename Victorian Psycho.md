I picked up this book largely on misunderstanding, as I thought it was something it wasn't. Due to this, I hwent into it assuming I woudln't like it as its premise of a psychopath compedy doesn't really appeal to me.

All that established, I thought this book was very well executed. It was exceedingly charming and some across to me like a Tim Burton film. While there were jokes that made me roll my eyes, the overall dry murderous tone was surprisingly pleasant. 

This book lost me alittle during the end. At this point, there were lapses in Notty's memory and we had to go into each murder wondering ig they were real or dreamt up, which hurt the tone and shape of the story to me even though I reognized some would say it *added* to Notty's madness. 

The final action witht he murder spree lost me a bit too. Though cinematic, the crossifre felt like a cold and uninteresting choice and honestly the whole thing felt a little unmotivated. Though I know she had nothing left to lose, the way that all the other murdersr esolved annoyances, kept secrets, or were mundane accidentas appealed to me more.

I believe I'm sitting at a 3.0 star review, which still puts it joyfully higher than I'd anticipated.
