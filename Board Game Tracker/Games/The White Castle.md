Description: The heron flies over the Himeji sky while the Daimyo, from the top of the castle, watches his servants move. Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court.

There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice...

> [!important] ==**THOUGHTS**==

I don't know why I want it. I've seen the box a couple times in reviews and discussion, it seems to play well at 2-4, and it seems complex and interesting in theme.

But realistically I don't know anything about this game.
