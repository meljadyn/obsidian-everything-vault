|[[The White Castle]]|Wishlist - Must Have|The heron flies over the Himeji sky while the Daimyo, from the top of the castle, watches his servants move. Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.  <br>  <br>In The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimyo Sakai Tadakiyo.  <br>  <br>The White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.  <br>  <br>The central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimyo to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice...|3.0172|Dice, Economic|Dice, Economic|1|3|4|Medium Heavy|March 1, 2025 9:48 AM|||4|80|1|80|0||Players: 1 - 4|Playing Time: 80 mins||2023|

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:  <br>  <br>As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.  <br>As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.  <br>  <br>  <br>Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.  <br>  <br>Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic.

|[[Cascadia]]|Wishlist - Must Have|Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.  <br>  <br>In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available &mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.  <br>  <br>Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs.

Players collect one of these goods when the feature that has it on the tile is scored. Players with the most of each type of good gets bonus points at the end of the game. (There is a popular house rule that allows the trading of goods between players in exchange for other goods and the ability to choose where a tile is placed.) There are also two new wooden playing pieces in this expansion. The Builder is like a meeple in that it may be placed in a city or on a road as a kind of supervisor. A subsequent tile played that extends the feature the Builder is in allows the player a bonus tile placement. Farmers will also be able to place a new Pig pawn in a field for extra points at the end of the game.  <br>  <br>Finally, Traders &amp; Builders comes with a large cloth bag. Not only does this make it easier to keep and handle the tiles, but it also removes the problem of having non-identical backsides.  <br>  <br>Carcassonne: Traders &amp; Builders Expansion Play Summary  <br>  <br>  <br>Traders - Some of the new city tiles depict goods: wine, grain and/or cloth. When you complete a city, your own or someone else's, you collect a matching token for each good in the city. At game end, whoever has the most goods in each category scores an additional 10 points.  <br>Builders - Each player receives a builder meeple in his/her color. You can add your builder to any city or road you already have in progress. Thereafter anytime you add a tile to that city or road, you immediately get to take another turn. The builder does not count as a follower for determining control of a city or road.  <br>Pig - You can add your pig to one of your farms to enrich its value.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.  <br>  <br>Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.  <br>  <br>A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.  <br>  <br>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points.

|[[7 Wonders Duel]]|Owned|In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders. Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.  <br>  <br>Players do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.  <br>  <br>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.  <br>  <br>You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.|2.2248|Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Civilization, Economic|Ancient, Card Game, City Building, Civilization, Economic|2|2|2|Medium Light|March 1, 2025 7:20 PM|||2|30|2|30|0||Players: 2|Playing Time: 30 mins||2015|

|[[Anomia]]|Owned|Anomia plays off the fact that our minds are positively brimming with all sorts of random information: things to eat, pop songs, websites, etc... Sure, under normal circumstances, it's easy to give an example of a frozen food or a dog breed, but you'll find that your brain works a little differently under pressure!  <br>  <br>To play, draw and reveal a card from the center pile. Does the symbol on your card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by giving an example of the person, place, or thing on their card before they can do the same for yours. If you blurt out a correct answer first, you win their card and the drawing continues.  <br>  <br>Sounds simple, right? Wrong! Wild cards allow non-matching symbols to match, increasing the number of things to which you must pay attention. Cascading face-offs can occur when you hand over a lost card, thereby revealing a new top card on your play pile.|1.0395|Party Game, Real-time, Trivia, Word Game|Party Game, Real-time, Trivia, Word Game|3|5|6|Very Light|March 1, 2025 5:19 PM|||6|30|3|30|0||Players: 3 - 6|Playing Time: 30 mins||2010|
|[[Carcassonne]]|Owned|Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.  <br>  <br>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.  <br>  <br>First game in the Carcassonne series.|1.8892|Medieval, Territory Building|Medieval, Territory Building|2|2|5|Light|March 1, 2025 5:19 PM||[[Carcassonne- Expansion 1 – Inns & Cathedrals]]|5|45|2|30|0||Players: 2 - 5|Playing Time: 30-45 mins||2000|
|[[Gloomhaven- Jaws of the Lion]]|Owned|Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters &mdash; Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) &mdash; that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.  <br>  <br>The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?  <br>  <br>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry &mdash; i.e., learning the game &mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.|3.6388|Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures|Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures|1|2|4|Heavy|May 3, 2025 12:48 PM|||4|120|1|30|0||Players: 1 - 4|Playing Time: 30-120 mins||2020|
|[[Frosthaven]]|Owned|Frosthaven is the story of a small outpost far to the north of the capital city of White Oak. It's an outpost barely surviving the harsh weather let alone invasions from forces both known and unknown. However, a group of mercenaries, at the end of their rope, will help bring this settlement back from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but with other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold, as well. There are: Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors have it that there are machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.  <br>  <br>Frosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign. Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.  <br>  <br>In addition to using the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features other elements, such as mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how the ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.  <br>  <br>Frosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanism for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as Frosthaven's outpost is a remote location, these products may be imported but are not present as standard items. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buying them.  <br>  <br>&mdash;description from the publisher|4.4139|Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures|Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures|1|3|4|Very Heavy|May 3, 2025 12:48 PM|||4|180|1|90|0||Players: 1 - 4|Playing Time: 90-180 mins||2022|
|[[Brass- Birmingham]]||Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution between the years of 1770 and 1870.  <br>  <br>It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build and establish your industries and network in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.  <br>  <br>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):  <br>  <br>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.  <br>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.  <br>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.  <br>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.  <br>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.  <br>  <br>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:  <br>  <br>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card.

|[[A Game of Thrones- The Board Game (Second Edition)]]|Wishlist - Must Have|Game description from the publisher:  <br>  <br>King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.  <br>  <br>In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!  <br>  <br>To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.  <br>  <br>Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.  <br>  <br>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!  <br>  <br>During the Act...|3.7309|Bluffing, Fantasy, Negotiation, Novel-based, Political, Wargame|Bluffing, Fantasy, Negotiation, Novel-based, Political, Wargame|4|6|6|Heavy|June 2, 2025 11:15 PM|||6|240|3|120|0||Players: 3 - 6|Playing Time: 120-240 mins||2011|
