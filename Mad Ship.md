I adored this book. It's now 5 days after finishing it that I'm writing this review and I'm in a bit of a rush, but I hope I can capture a lot of what I loved about it. First of all, this is the first book in a long time that had me gasping, smacking it in excitement, and giving me all the warm feelings that made me love reading as a kid. I had been so worried to read this book because Ship of Magic was my all time favourite and I was afraid the series would get worse—I was wrong. It's better!

For one, I never realized how much I wanted to learn about the Rain Wilds until Reyn’s POV was added. I *love* learning more about the Rain Wild city and the only complaint I have is that realizing that they’re pillaging the remains of the Elderling city for profit, to the degree of killing living creatures by turning them into liveships, hurts my heart and makes me feel guilty for wanting Vivacia and Ophelia to just continue as they are, feeling like living beings instead of dead husks of once-living creatures.

Also, I finally understand! The serpents were the worst part of Ship of Magic and while I knew they would have a greater part in the rest of the series, I never dreamed it would be as important as it is! They’re the through-stone to the once-living dragons, now preserved only in wood that was being *butchered* for liveships. And oh, what that means for the Paragon! I love Paragon, but it’s also a horrible thing to realize he was made of two planks—he is *two* ancient creatures, torn apart and put back together, with a much of Ludwick thrown in, taken over by pirates once, slaughter after slaughter where blood is memory—I can’t. Also, after what happened to Kenny(?) the Ship, I’m afraid for all the liveships. I feel selfish for wanting things to “go back to normal” when I realize now that their whole everything has been thrown away and it would be more right for them to be entirely free of their families. 

Alright, trying to go back to the other characters. I like Kennit a lot more! He’s probably still my least favourite character (more by default than because I don’t like him now), but it really feels like something happened when Vivacia and Wintrow saved his life that day. Wintrow gave something of himself to Kennit and Kennit shared something with Wintrow, and as a consequence, Kennit is no longer a singular selfish figure the way he felt in the first book. There’s something of a kindness and empathy for at least Wintrow and likely Vivacia, and while he is still a bastard, he is one I can engage with now. The objective good that his actions are doing is really interesting as a counterbalance to his general disposition, and I can see why Wintrow would believe that serving him is Sa’s goal. 

I still love Althea and Brashen as well. Seeing Brashen become Captain Trell seems amazing and I’m really hoping he and Paragon can continue to sail (though I’m debating whether its
