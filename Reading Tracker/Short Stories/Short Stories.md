|[[Tough Times All Over]]|[[Joe Abercrombie]]|[[Red Country]]|[[Reading Tracker/Books/Rogues\|Rogues]]|[x]|4|<br>This short story was a lot of fun. Following a grimy package that we never learn the contents of, we switch points of view frequently and seamlessly, and I adore it. So many different people and yet nearly all of them are presented in an instantly engaging and relatable way. Often when the point of view shifted, you wished for just a little more on that troubled individual you'd just left behind.<br><br>I really enjoyed the author's narrative voice and I can definitely see myself reading from this author again.<br>|April 24, 2023||

|[[The Inn of the Seven Blessings]]|[[Matthew Hughes]]||[[Reading Tracker/Books/Rogues\|Rogues]]|[x]|2.25|<br>This one was alright, but unfortunately not a perfect cup of tea for me. Though the story was fun in concept, I never found myself bonding with Raffalon as a reader, and ended up fairly uninterested in any of his plights or victories. <br><br>A fun concept, and an okay execution. <br>|April 19, 2023||

|[[How the Marquis Got His Coat Back]]|[[Neil Gaiman]]|[[London Below]]|[[Reading Tracker/Books/Rogues\|Rogues]]|[x]|4|Now this was a super enjoyable story. This is my first Neil Gaiman story and I've got to say that I had a smashing time of it. Satirical and amusing to a fault, you can't help but root for the finding of Marquis' coat, which is of course magnificent and the color of a wet street at night.<br><br>It was a super fun read that kept giving, and the humor actually landed. <br><br><section class="inline spoiler"><br>I also found immense satisfaction in the fact that one of my early and odd questions was actually explained narratively. <br><br>I had wondered why the letter was so conveniently enclosed in a plastic bag—because surely that wasn't just to save it from the water-filled room that happened to come by later?<br><br>I ended up immensely satisfied to realise it was actually trapped, which explained the bag and foreshadowed the ill-intention quite nicely.<br></section>|April 24, 2023||

|[[The Lightning Tree]]|[[Patrick Rothfuss]]|[[The Kingkiller Chronicle]]|[[Reading Tracker/Books/Rogues\|Rogues]]|[x]|4.75|<br>This was one of my favourite reads in long while. My impression was a bit lower on the first page, when I realised that the writing style wasn't quite as magical as I expected. But all of that was quickly forgotten when we were pulled through Bast's day, and wow. <br><br>There's something mysterious and entrancing about his work at the Lightning Tree, about being paid in secrets and offering truth in kind. The anger and punishment that came with the boy who lied to him. <br><br>I can't explain why I liked it so much. It was almost like a fairytale, but told by the wrong perspective. Told by someone not quite fairytale-worthy and yet magical nonetheless.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed it more than I expected, and it's reminded me why I've been planning to re-read the first and finally complete the second book of the Kingkiller Chronicles. <br><br>Rothfuss certainly has a way with entrancing and powerful characters. <br>|April 24, 2024||
