Review: <br>This was one of my favourite reads in long while. My impression was a bit lower on the first page, when I realised that the writing style wasn't quite as magical as I expected. But all of that was quickly forgotten when we were pulled through Bast's day, and wow. <br><br>There's something mysterious and entrancing about his work at the Lightning Tree, about being paid in secrets and offering truth in kind. The anger and punishment that came with the boy who lied to him. <br><br>I can't explain why I liked it so much. It was almost like a fairytale, but told by the wrong perspective. Told by someone not quite fairytale-worthy and yet magical nonetheless.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed it more than I expected, and it's reminded me why I've been planning to re-read the first and finally complete the second book of the Kingkiller Chronicles. <br><br>Rothfuss certainly has a way with entrancing and powerful characters. <br>
