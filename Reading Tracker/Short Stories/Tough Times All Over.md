Review: <br>This short story was a lot of fun. Following a grimy package that we never learn the contents of, we switch points of view frequently and seamlessly, and I adore it. So many different people and yet nearly all of them are presented in an instantly engaging and relatable way. Often when the point of view shifted, you wished for just a little more on that troubled individual you'd just left behind.<br><br>I really enjoyed the author's narrative voice and I can definitely see myself reading from this author again.<br>
