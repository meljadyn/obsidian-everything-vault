Review: This was a thoroughly enjoyable tromp in a magical setting that I really enjoyed. <br><br>I found the beginning somewhat frustrating and busy, featuring a large range of new people and a fanciful very magical city, but once I settled in, I was in for a great time. <br><br>It really was just a fun adventure, with a small band of adventerurs/thieves given what sounds like an impossible task, and doing their best work to beat the odds. <br><br>More enjoyable than it should've been, and an overall great time.
