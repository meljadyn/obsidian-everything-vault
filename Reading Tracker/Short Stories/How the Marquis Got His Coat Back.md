Review: Now this was a super enjoyable story. This is my first Neil Gaiman story and I've got to say that I had a smashing time of it. Satirical and amusing to a fault, you can't help but root for the finding of Marquis' coat, which is of course magnificent and the color of a wet street at night.<br><br>It was a super fun read that kept giving, and the humor actually landed. <br><br><section class="inline spoiler"><br>I also found immense satisfaction in the fact that one of my early and odd questions was actually explained narratively. <br><br>I had wondered why the letter was so conveniently enclosed in a plastic bag—because surely that wasn't just to save it from the water-filled room that happened to come by later?<br><br>I ended up immensely satisfied to realise it was actually trapped, which explained the bag and foreshadowed the ill-intention quite nicely.<br></section>
