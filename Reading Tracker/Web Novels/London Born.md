Review: I really enjoyed how willing this story was to leave canon behind. I enjoyed the sheer amount of original content as well as the overall pacing of tragedy and moving on from those tragedies. However, character moments always fell a little flatter for me then I’d like — I didn’t feel as connected to characters as I wanted to when they were suffering, barring one or two examples. This was a bummer for me considering just how many character moments there were in this story.Realistically though, this was very very well done. I’ll be reading the next one as well.
