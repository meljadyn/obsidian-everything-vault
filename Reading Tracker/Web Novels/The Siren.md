Review: I adore just how deeply this story explored World War II. I didn’t expect it, but the depth of it was breathtaking, and it really felt real. The depiction of her as a spy never felt too much like a power fantasy, and again, I just really liked the slow build up and realism of the war. You felt for how it affected everyone.I also very much mourned the Siren’s disappearance. Up until modern day, that was a masterclass in mourning, especially considering I knew she was coming back. That said, .5 of a star is knocked off for the modern section of the story. I don’t know that we needed that much time in modern day to reach the resolution. On one hand, it did make me feel for Steve deeply, but on the other, it wasn’t really his story that I was trying to explore.And honestly, while I desperately needed a happy ending by the end (which is rare for me), the Bragi ending felt a little bit too out of place for me to feel full satisfaction from it.
