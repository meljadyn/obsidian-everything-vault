Review: I’ve written a good amount of my thoughts already in my long-form review as I reading. Overall, I was huge fan of this book. The setting was very unlike most other works that I read, and the concept (very mafia-like) is something that I’m not exposed to very much in my day-to-day. I loved the way that Jade worked, and even more, I loved watching people struggle with it, with powerful withdrawals or even the affects of two much. I like that Jade, despite being this magical, wonderful thing, is essentially a drug, with all the ill-effects you’d expect with it.The family was lovely. Hilo is much more complex than I feel you usually see with his archetype, and Lan’s desperation to keep the Kaul family standing, and the struggles he endures even just with the burden of too much Jade, was just wonderful.This story came across as one that didn’t pull its punches, for reasons that I can’t fully go into here (as this review is aiming to be mostly non-spoiler. Overall, I loved it. It was a setting I hadn’t been exposed to, with a tight-knit family, high stakes, and slow character-work. Jade City surpassed all of my expectations and more.What a wonderful book to get back into reading with.
