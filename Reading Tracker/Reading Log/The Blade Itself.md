Review: "I want to give this a much higher rating. I'm really enjoying this book and all the major characters in it. Unfortunately I picked it up during a reading slump and so read through it rather slowly.This immediately lands on my re-read list for when I can fully fully enjoy it, but even as it is, I did enjoy my first read through. I was surprisingly engaged with Logen, with his old crew, and even Jezal, the prick. Glokta is a love it or hate it guy—I like reading about him but I was less intrigued about reading about his plot, so it balanced out to average there. I haven't bonded with Ferro yet, as she's more revenge than person, but I look forward to seeing where that goes.I really enjoyed West's PoV when we got it too, rare as it is. The last 80% of the book is great though, with so much happening and so much excitement, especially compared to the slower start. I don't mind slow though, and getting to these characters has been a pleasure. "
