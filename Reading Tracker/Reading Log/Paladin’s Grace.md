Review: "I honestly really enjoyed this one. For my typical tastes, it was very romance heavy, but I enjoyed the writing style enough that it didn't matter. It was funny and the story as a whole felt ... just the tiniest bit absurd. When they fell for each other too quickly, I didn't mind it, for it felt like that kind of story, and I loved both characters very much.There was lots of plot going on with assassinations and heads and all that good stuff, but it really was about these two people and how they healed together.That said, the premise behind Stephen was interesting enough that I wanted more. To my knowledge, other works of T. Kingfisher contain more of the paladins, and I'll definitely be checking it out. "
