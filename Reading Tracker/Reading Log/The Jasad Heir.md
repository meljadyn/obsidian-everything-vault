Review: "I'm not sure about my rating for this one. I liked the first half more than the second. I really liked her friendship with her two friends, but unfortunately as the book went on, it felt like we were supposed to believe they were friends despite nearly no meaningful scenes with them aside from necessary plot-scenes. A lot more time went into the relationship between Sylvia and the Heir which I honestly never bought. Their relationship felt very \"ooh sexy tropey\" from the beginning, by which I mean that scenes that were meant to be terrifying always had a layer of \"dominating sexy\" to them for some reason.I did like some of the world building and ideas here, but the execution fell short for me in the end.I also thought there was a bit of dallying in general that could've been cut out in the training chapters underground. Solidly average for me and unfortunately I was looking forward to finishing it. "
