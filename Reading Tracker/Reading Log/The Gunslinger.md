Review: This was a strange read for me. It felt like I was simultaneously invested and impatiently awaiting the end of a chapter so I could put it down. I had some issues with the writing style. It often felt like the main actions of the plot were secondary, and if I was paying any less than complete attention, I'd miss the specifics of what happened, as all the specific details of even major events felt buried.Still, I liked it. I liked watching the Gunslinger's journey, and watching him interact with all he found on his way. For all the faults I find in the narrative style for my preference, it did well at demonstrating a character that is so singularly focused and almost dry that it's hard for anything else to matter.Overall, I enjoyed this book and I'm glad I read it. There was something about the interactions between characters that felt like it should've been bland but was instead fascinating. The world it is building up was surreal and confusing, and you couldn't help but wonder how it came to be this way, and why everyone is the way they are.It's rare for a book to edge me nearly into boredom while also grabbing me for investment, but this one managed it. I rarely cared to pick it up, but when I did, I generally enjoyed it.I might continue this series one day, or I may not. But I'm not sad to have read this entry.
