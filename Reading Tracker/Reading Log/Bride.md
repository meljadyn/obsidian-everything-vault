Review: This book was very fun, and I appreciate it for being fun. It felt so much like Wattpad and AO3 and that side of writing that I’m honestly surprised it got published, but pleased! As always with novels like this, I find myself confused by its shorter length, but that’s just because I read doorstoppers when I’m on AO3. Overall it was fun, but the characters themselves were only okay at best, and the stakes were never quite as high as I hoped they’d be. That said, I’ll probably read its sequel when it came out, because this was such a short and fun read that I can’t see why not.That all said, the smut can be very detailed. So not easy to recommend.
