Review: This was an odd read for me. I definitely had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I wanted to read another Neil Gaiman book after reading his short story, How The Marquis Got His Coat Back.And this was a lot like that—partially because the Marquis himself is from (or in) this story, which was a pleasant surprise.I actually really liked the beginning of this book, and I really liked it from a bit past the middle to the end of it, but from about 20% through to 50%, it really wasn't doing much for me. At that point, I just didn't care about Richard, or any of the other chatacters, or what they were doing. I did certainly get the feeling of being a fish out of water, but without a character to anchor to, I didn't enjoy it very much.Once it picked back up though, and Richard stopped existing listlessly, and we started to learn what Door was trying to achieve, it was fun and enjoyable and altogether a great read.I loved the writing style of this story, and when the story was good, it was great. I wish I could've loved the whole thing, but I'll take what I can get and leave with an overall positive impression.
