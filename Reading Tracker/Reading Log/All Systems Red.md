Review: "This book was enjoyable, but not for me. Though I liked reading in Murderbot's perspective, at the end of the day I didn't feel very attached to any of the characters (main character included) and I never ended up caring about the story.It was an interesting perspective and premise, but it fell very average to me. Not mad that I read it, but definitely not for me in the end. "
