Review: "I read this book to fulfill a challenge to read a fantasy book based in mythology.It's not something I'd typically have read and it surprised me. The story is told mostly in two parts, with a set up and a fall, you could say.Though at times I was almost bored, I was also intrigued. I feel like the story will stay with me for a long time coming. There's something about reading about Angrboda, a mother, that was very compelling. Her heartbreak was awful, and her journey afterwards almost unsatisfying in its inability to save herself or her loved ones.There was a plainness in this book that made it feel more like myth than a typical story. There was almost a distance between myself and the character that I can't fully describe, though I can't say that it was intentional.I liked this story. I felt this story. And I appreciate the ending, which didn't aim to vastly change the original myth, to save those characters we knew and loved. I love that we don't entirely know what happened to them.Overall, a compelling way to describe Ragnarok, in the perspective of a heartbroken mother who knew too much. "
