Review: This review has spoilersThis was a fantastic sequel to all that occurred in the previous story. With only brief introductions to our characters and the set up to the next year's of their life, we move forward five years later, where they have settled into their ways, all in different places.Ali has his grove in the desert, Nahri in the heart in the politically unstable djinn city, and Dara under the thumb of the oldest living Bahu Nahida, raised from the dead.Watching Dara fall apart was heartbreaking, simultaneously expected and terrible, as he agrees to his new Bahu Nahida's whims and takes on an assault beyond terror.Watching Nahri struggle to hold onto herself and protect her city when others are constantly paying for her mistakes, trying to thrive and create a better world, is wonderful.Seeing Ali finally come into himself, his powers, and leadership, still struggling to balance his sight of justice as well as his execution in such a politically driven land. Trying to console the parts of him that wished family and loyalty was everything, and the part of him that wished to do better than them. It's amazing.That's not even talking about Jamshid and Muntadhir, both characters that grew so much, intertwined in a hidden way, but their stories so so seperate, as Muntadhir finally learns what it is to love his family, to question his father, and his potential responsibility to his land and his wife. Jamshid learning to accept his injuries and serve the kingdom in a way he might not have imagined, with no clue about his Nahid power shimmering beneath the surface.Overall, this was a perfect followup, just as politically charged, with the powerful, terrible, and awe-striking assault representing its finale, where Nahri makes a choice that from the outside is counter to her people, her goals, and the city's safety, and from the inside, is a confusing mess of questions, hopes, that honestly, is likely the best chance that Daevabad has to survive this.
