Review: "Despite what you may believe by the star rating, I didn't dislike the book. I'm just extremely lukewarm to it.Despite its acclaim, I honestly just never ended up fully invested. Noemí was alright as a character, but I never fully clicked with her. While I liked the tension between some of the characters, I was never sold on the creepy or horror elements, and I was never fully drawn into the setting.It was interesting, but it wasn't anything special for me. I rooted for the main character, but almost more out of habit than out of a liking for her.Overall, an average read. Not as horror driven as I was hoping, though it features some interesting character dynamics. I don't regret reading it, but it's not as fantastic as I'd been hoping for me. "
