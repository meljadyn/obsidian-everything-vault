Review: This review has spoilers.Altogether better than I had expected. The journey that Claire takes is exciting and startlingly more grounded than I expected. Weather, fever, or a single wolf can become a far larger issue in the end than other books will have you believe, where characters may casually stab a wolf, or ignore the aching pains of long journeys.It was a bit high in romance for my tastes, but I did know that going in, and I do have an appreciation for what's there. Overall it was a thrilling journey told slowly and carefully, and Claire, with her love of medicine and botany, makes a great character to follow, with her own ambitions and strengths, and with a perspective that gives us, the modern readers, some space to breathe.That said, I think I began to grow weary of Jamie and Claire, which makes sense for me seeing as I am not a romance reader. I loved the chapters where Claire was with Murtagh, and I was fine with the chapters with Jamie and Claire, but I think my interest in that relationship did begin to wane as the story went on.
