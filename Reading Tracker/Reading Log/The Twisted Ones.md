Review: "I liked it overall. Reading it at night, especially the beginning, was incredibly creepy, though maybe not scary. I liked the setting a lot — cleaning up after her grandmother's hoarding in a town she'd only been to as a child.Honestly, the part where it lost me was when they were captured and went into the city of the effigies. Though I appreciate the revelations and i actually think the explanation is just fantastic—a weakened magic, dark kingdom that is now just rebuilding itself by copies, slaving endlessly to make more with no more of the original masters—I have to admit, seeing behind the scenes in that city took away a lot of the mystery and tension. The effigies \"tumbling\" and deliberating, essentially having discussions—I feel it ruined the tension somewhat. That said, the ending was also very good. Anna likely being killed after her betrayal, saving her from suffering, the reveal that the deer effigy was Colgrave, the building of the second effigy—honestly I really liked it. It was a good book that lost me a little near the end but brought me back. It's bizarre because while I hated the mystery being dropped, I also really liked the explanation, and it's really cool looking back. "
