Review: This review has spoilers.This was a decent follow up to all that occurred before. I still miss Rhys' moral grey. It bothered me to no end how badass Feyre was despite her resounding lack of training compared to everyone else. She was far too adept as a spy and manipulator in Tamlin's court.Since I'm largely reading this as an angsty, trope-y guilty pleasure sort of deal, I kind of wish we had gotten a bit more of the aftermath between her and Tamlin one on one. Narratively, leaving it unspoken is better, but eh, that's not really what I read this sort of story for.I loved getting better acquainted with Cassian, Mor, and Azriel. They're awesome, and one of the best parts of this. Overall, if you're reading this for tropeyness, this one is okay. Not as trope-y and "bad movie" vibes as the previous one, as this one mostly focused on the war efforts. It had its epic moments though, and I did very much enjoy the unleashing of the old gods in the final battle.Overall, decent. If you're a massive fan of this series, this book probably would've been pretty satisfying and exciting.
