I thought I’d hate this book when I started it. The preview I was given on Book of the Month wasn’t the beginning and reading the beginning really made me roll my eyes. And at the end of the day, I had only picked it because it was the best of choices I wan’t particularly interested in in the first place. That said, I have wanted to try more who-dunnit mysteries, and this was set up to be one.

The first half of the book, I didn’t really like it. I would have DNF’d it if I didn’t feel I was so close to finishing it and because honestly I had reading goals this year that I knew this book would make easy. So, I went ahead and attempted to finish it. And I’m glad I did! My biggest criticisms of the book were the writing style, which felt a little too simplistic and modern to me, and the characters. The writing, I got used to. The characters, who had given 0 singular shits about in the beginning of the story, eventually blossomed into characters I was curious about and enjoyed.

A great example of this were the nameless criminal roommates Aubrey had in her back pocket. They were … there? But over time, the comaraderie was a little more contagious. I genuinely think this would be a better webnovel with more filler, because I really would have bought into these relationships more with just more time. For example, I didn’t care much about Frank’s betrayal. Who cares?

But as the characters became more interesting, like Camille and Sean, Aubrey and Deacon, I bought in just enough to enjoy the story. And it *was* enjoyable. I did not guess who had done it *or* who had driven the car even though I think the signs were there enough that I wasn’t blindsided. I didn’t adore this story and I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it unless it was just the only one I had in my roster to fill a niche, but I liked it well enough by the end that it earned the 2.5 stars I gave it. Maybe. Could downgrade to 2 stars just because the first half was such a slog because I cared nothing-at-all for everyone involved. I don’t think I should have to wait halfway through a book to give a shit.
