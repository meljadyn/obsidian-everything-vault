Review: This review has spoilersThis is my first Drizzt novel and the world building in the Underdark frequently awed me. I loved the setting of this book, and despite the fact that I know Drizzt should irritate me, as he is very much a Mary Sue, skilled at anything he attempts ... he just doesn't.I rooted for Drizzt like no other and cheered for him when he faced foes. I was euphoric when Masoj finally fell on the end, and I never would've forgiven R.A. Salvatore if the panther had truly perished.However, this book did struggle to hold my attention through the first half, though I have no idea why. And I found the subplot of Zaknefein and Drizzt both assuming the other was evil extremely tiring. The misunderstanding trope is one of the worst, and that holds for father and son just as much as it does for the classic couple's plight.Overall, I've rarely rooted for a hero as thoroughly as I did for Drizzt, and the Underdark fascinated me as a setting, despite the fact that I spent the entirely story wishing Drizzt would just leave it, as he's way too good for the place.4/5 and a worthwhile read to be sure.
