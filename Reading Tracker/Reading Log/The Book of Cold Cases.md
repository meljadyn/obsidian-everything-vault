Review: This review has spoilersThe writing style of this book is simple, one of the simplest I've read in a long time. At first it bothered me, but it quickly faded into the background and almost added to the atmosphere. It felt almost as though I was listening to a podcast, which is where true crime stories flourish these days.I never read in this genre and I picked this book up spontaneously. I'm glad I did. It was a great story that I finished in less than two days, and it held my attention all the way through. It isn't a story that I think will stay with me forever, but it was a good one.As it went on, I found myself growing tired of the constant flashbacks to Beth. I think the flashbacks were valuable, but overall more was told through them than necessary. I think I would've preferred the mystery of only having key moments shown to us, and the rest being hearsay.I really loved the book when it started but got less interested as it went on. Shea's story was my priority, and current-Beth's as well, so all the time we spent looking at her past lost my interest a fair bit.That said, I enjoyed this book, and it's certainly better than average. I'd give it a 3.5 perhaps, if halves were an option.
