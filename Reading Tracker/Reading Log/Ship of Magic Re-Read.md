Review: I'm pretty tired, but I want to make it clear that I love this book. It might be my favorite book, full stop. I'm simultaneously excited and terrified to read the next two. I just feel for the characters so deeply. There aren't many books where I just want to beg the plot to stop and give my favourite characters exactly what they want, because you really feel their aching tiredness and their real disappointment. Not in a loud over the top tears way, but in a familiar way, in the way that makes you remember what it feels like to carry pain day by day and try to swallow it so it doesn't swallow you. I don't know. I just really love this book.
