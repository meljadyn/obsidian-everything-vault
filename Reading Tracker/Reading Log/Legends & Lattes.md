Review: This was a really great read. Somewhat of a pioneer of low stakes/cozy fantasy in a non-Earth setting, I really enjoyed seeing a new take on fantasy as a genre. It's lovely to enjoy the setting and magic of a fantasy world in a more ... mundane story of you will. It was satisfying and gratifying experiencing every small win and victory as we watch Viv's progress building up her new life.A great and quick read overall. While I liked the characters, I didn't fall in love with them, but honestly, I enjoyed the story anyway. It was gratifying, simple, and for me, very quick.I typically tend to higher stake fantasy, but honestly, this book is a great breath of fresh air between bigger reads, and I can definitely see the use of a subgenre like this one in the future.
