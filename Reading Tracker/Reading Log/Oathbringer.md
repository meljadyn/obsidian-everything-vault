Review: This review has spoilersIt feels wrong to give this book 3 stars. Both the previous novels were 5 star reads for me, and this book was in many ways a fantastic follow up.This novel followed through on giving me more of the characters I loved, honing in more on their growth, and finally unfolded the great mysteries of Dalinar's past, which was unbelievably exciting and interesting to finally understand and see for ourselves.However, it took me a year to finish this book. A full year. This is not entirely the fault of the book — during more than half of this time, I wasn't doing much reading at all. But regardless, I struggled to want to pick this book up, especially during the early chapters in Urithiru. I generally enjoyed what I was reading, though I certainly experienced some political fatigue in some of Dalinar's chapters, but nonetheless it was genuinely difficult to convince myself to pick this book up.It's a shame, because I loved so much of it. Almost all of Alethkar's chapters had my attention, as well as Dalinar's flashbacks. I relished in seeing a lot of the characters grow, from Teft, to Shallan and her struggled accepting and controlling her alternate egos, to Kaladin accepting loss, and even to Adolin and his potentially awakened sword, Maya.Overall, I had a great time with so much of this book! But my unwillingness to pick it up can mean I can only do 3 stars. I am still an absolute fan of this series, which is epic on a scope I've never truly witnessed before. I hope on a re-read that this story strikes better, but no matter what I'm glad to have read it.
