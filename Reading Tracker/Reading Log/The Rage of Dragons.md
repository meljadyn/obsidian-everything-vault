Review: I didn’t write a review at the time of reading, which is tragic. But I loved this book.I fell in love with Tau’s just insane dedication to avenge his father, and I absolutely adored just how broken of a man he became. He was singular in purpose to the point where it was a complete flaw, but we watched just how dedicated he was, and felt for him in what he wanted so badly.I remember feeling viscerally frustrated that his peers were more than willing to reap the benefits of Tau’s training, but were so quick to attempt to deny him the reason he worked so hard, the reason he had the strength they were so pleased to take advantage of. On the flip side, I understood their frustrations when his actions were so against the needs of the rest of the group, seeing as they took care of each other otherwise.I deeply felt the embarrassment and frustration when Tau attempted the first time to enact his revenge and just wasn’t strong enough. It was tragic to watch just how pitiful he was against the noble who’d killed his father, and it made the moment later — when he chose to fight demons, just to gain the strength he needed for his revenge — so much more impactful.I loved this book. There were things I didn’t resonate with as much — funnily enough, the current political climate being one of them, and I’m sure I’ll need a re-read to understand that — but the Tau’s journey just deeply resonated with me.
