Review: Mort was a book that I loved and then liked. It begins with interesting characters, interesting settings, and a tone both humorous and whimsical. I laughed out loud several times, which is rare for me. I found the first half was an absolute joy, getting to know Mort, slowly beginning to understand Death, seeing Ankh Morpork.As it went on, I felt the characters became less fleshed, and the pace of certain events became a little rushed for my tastes. By the ending, things felt simultaneously resolved and just a bit unsatisfying, as though the true consequences and world was just a touch unresolved.Overall though, I loved Mort's beginnings as a boy trying to do right by his father, daydreaming more than he should, and struggling to understand his new job. I loved Death's journey to find happiness. And I was fairly invested in the princess and the wizard, struggling to be recognized.The connecting bits didn't particularly resonate with me. By the end I was ready to put it down, but this book has a lot of promise and I look forward to my next read in Discworld.Well worth the read, and I'm glad it was my first book in Discworld.
