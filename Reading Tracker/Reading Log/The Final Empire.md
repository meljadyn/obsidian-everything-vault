Review: "5% in: I read the prologue and honestly I'm really enjoying it. I loved the characterization and the worldbuilding, and how quickly I was able to catch on and really feel the weariness and resigned nature of the Skaa.<br><br>I'm super excited to continue and I'm glad I picked it up. I hope the excitement continues throughout the whole reading experience. Later:I was hesitant to start this book, since I've just finished Six of Crows as a palette cleanser for a larger scope and slower fantasy story.<br><br>To my knowledge, this book (like Six of Crows) is a heist story, and I've never considered myself to be a heist story person in general. <br><br>I've been meaning to read it for a while though, and if how much I enjoyed the Stormlight Archives is any indication, I think I'll love this book. Especially as I know this one to be quicker paced and less massive in scope, because while I love the Stormlight Archives, I also find it as exhausting as it is thrilling."
