Review: This review has spoilers.This book was interesting for me to say the least. First and foremost, it is my first classic. The difference in writing style compared to what I'm accustomed to definitely impacted my thoughts on it, as I was struggling with the idea of whether I would place this at 3/5 or 4/5.The beginning I found relatively interesting, with the introduction of Dorian Grey and Basil. Truthfully at this point, I had no interest in Lord Henry. I found Lord Henry was either a brilliant character or an unbearable one, as he constantly bounced from genuinely wise and thoughtful, to what I could only interpret as trying to say something interesting and quote worthy despite the truth behind his words being rather lackluster.I was neutral to the book until the introduction of Sybil Vane at which point I enjoyed it rather thoroughly until the end — excepting chapter 11, which took several days to get through, though that could be just as much because I read it in small sessions and in distracted times as it was because the chapter was actually poorly done. I liked the idea of chapter 11 but for whatever reason I couldn't enjoy it.The slow corruption of Dorian Gray was something I did enjoy though, and I like the way he passed in the end as well. The role reversal and the stark lack of beauty, poetry, or preparation really seemed to fit the ending. It was incredibly unsatisfying in the best way.Overall I really liked it, though I was also admittedly excited for it to be over as the writing style was somewhat draining to me, probably because I was so out of practice with reading. That said, I think most reading fanatics should read this book at least once I'm very glad I did.
