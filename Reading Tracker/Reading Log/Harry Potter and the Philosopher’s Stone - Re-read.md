Review: This is a re-read for me. Unfortunately I've read this book more than any other in the series, and have watched the movie many times more. Which is to say that while it's good, it's definitely gotten a bit tired for me.I was actually very surprised to realise that this book is constantly moving, almost too quickly. Every scene matters, to a very literal degree. There is very little in there that is designed just to establish people or relationships. Instead, everything that happens is easily linked to the immediate story—or will come up in the coming chapters.At times the story felt brief to a fault. A notable amount of the book was more a brief overview of a large span of time told passively from the future, rather than an active and current scene.Overall I love this story and I love this world more than I can express. Specifically the world, Hogwarts, the magic—it feels magical and incredible and it makes you want to live there, more than any other story I've read.But I've read it many times, and I was surprised by how summarised and brief the story was. It's appropriate for its audience, as a middle grade book, but it did take me by surprise.I'm looking forward to moving onto the books that I haven't read as often, but this will always be a fun adventure in a world I love to experience.
