Review: I really liked this one. The first one I had some trouble with on first-read, as I went into it with the wrong expectations. (I expected far more dragons and far less interpersonal and political conflicts). I re-read Natural History of Dragons before reading this one (with all the correct expectations!) and enjoyed it much more, and that carried through to here. I enjoyed watching Isabella find herself a bit more here, as she's no longer living in her husband's shadow, for better or for worse. Her relationship with Natalie and with Tom Wilker was lovely to read, even if it wasn't frenetically personal.I'm just loving the realism of this series, with how long these expeditions take to plan, with how "little" they seem to get done, and the discovery of local people, cultures, and politics just as much as we learn about dragons.
