Review: I know I wrote a review for this but it seems it didn't save, and it's now been over half a year since I've read it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book though. I was intrigued by all three PoVs and was just sucked into the deep grief of the early chapters. The story felt real, perhaps to a fault, with no storybook happy endings and romances. It all felt raw to the point where it was almost boring, with none of the perfect suspense of friendship and romance that you come to expect in a novel. But that's what I liked about it — it was refreshing. Overall a great read with a writing style I remember enjoying as well. Definitely one of the better reads of the year!
