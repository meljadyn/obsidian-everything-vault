Review: |-
  We started off strong with this book. I *loved* the prologue. Something about Egwene spoke to mea nd I loved how biased her whole chapter was. She was a hypocrite and I loved that she was allowed to be.

  Loving Egwene behind, I also loved the setting. The excitement over a single Peddler or Gleeman was palbaple, and it's honestly a tragedy that we never got to enjoy the fair the characters were so excited for. *But* Thom. Thom is amazing. I didn't expect them to make a character of Thom but I loved him and honestly I liked that he was one of the driving forces behind the suspicion of Morraine, which was another theme I loved in this story.

  However, no story is without flaws and honestly it's Rand. I didn't notice that I found him dull until I got to be in Perrin's head and I realized I liked Perrin more. I can't wait to see more about his Wit. Rand was an unfortunately blank slate for a lot of the story, especially as he is lacking even the simple "gimmicks" that other characters are given, like Mat's pranks or Perrin being "slow".

  On another note, I understand the comparisons to the Lord of the Rings. The Fade, the dagger Mat found (which affected him much like the Ring did Frodo), Lan as the reluctant kinda-King, the small band of underestimated farmers (which drew comparison to the Hobbits). Though the story didn't follow the same exact script, the long journey on foot coupled with those similarities were a little much. You could definitely see Tolkien's influence.

  Overall though, I liked quite a few of the characters and I really enjoyed the world-building. While the pacing did often feel a little Monster of the Week, I didn't feel that stopped me from enjoying the book.Probably a 4.5 star read, despite the obvious inspiration and some of the formulaic tendencies. I enjoyed the characters enough that I almost feel its more than they deserve (as I don't quite feel they were well-fleshed enough to justify it), but I love them nonetheless.
