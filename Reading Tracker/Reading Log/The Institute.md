Review: This review has spoilersI quite enjoyed this book, and absolutely adored the characters in it. From Luke to Avery to Sha to Nick, I loved them, and when Iris was lost I felt it too. When Luke's parents were lost I felt it.That said, this book was good. It was interesting and held my attention well, but it didn't feel like it brought anything particularly new to any table. That said, it had an ending both satisfying and unsatisfying in exactly the way it ought to be, and Tim carried the climax in just the right way for it to be a pretty great book, if not particularly mind blowing in any which way.I enjoyed it, and so it got a 3.5. It was my first King book and it's a good one, and though it didn't blow my mind, it did everything it did well and I'm pleased I read it.
