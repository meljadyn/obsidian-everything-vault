Review: I found myself thinking of this book more than I expected and attempted to start its sequel quite recently. Shortly after starting, I decided a re-read was in order. Honestly, it's a good story, especially if you go in with the right expectations. There's also just something about the story that makes you look forward to more — Isabella feels incomplete. The narrative voice is so much stronger and more worldly than this version of Isabella, and it leaves you wanting to see the woman she becomes. Upgraded rating from 3.75 to 4.25
