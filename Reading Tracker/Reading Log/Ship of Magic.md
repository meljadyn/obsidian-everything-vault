Review: "It's getting late, as always when I finish a book.But let's just say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and also that it was far more miserable than I expected, and that I really enjoyed it.If I had to choose, I have to admit I loved reading about Althea and Brennan. I loved Vivacia but also, her pain and Wintrow's were really just heartbreaking and I was not prepared for it.Paragon, I also loved, and I didn't tire of the women holding the Vestrit household together, Ronica and Keffria.I actually still don't know how I feel about Kennit. I found his chapters interesting enough, but it's so hard to get a read on him as a character that I don't know at all how I feel about him.But ooh, I can't even express what a joy Ophelia was! She got me through the super dark Vivacia moments.Now, the dishonourable mentions: I could strangle Kyle and Malta. They're just the absolute worst. Torg sucked, but at least he was just a bully. Kyle sucked in a super human paternal way and I hated him. Malta needs to suck it up and act her age!Characters aside (though truthfully, what am I reading a Robin Hobb book for but character?), I am unbelievably interested in the Rain Wild and I would love to know more about their culture, their magics, and their connections to the Bingtown Traders.All in all, this book is just so good. Just really good. That said, Robin Hobb books also just really hit my mental health sometimes and this was no exception. Damn, Robin Hobb knows how to make me stressed. Worth it, but damn this woman. I love her. "
