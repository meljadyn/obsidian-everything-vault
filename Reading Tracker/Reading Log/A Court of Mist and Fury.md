Review: This review has spoilersIt is still trope-y and imperfect, just as the first book was. However, if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, this book might still be for you.I think it's ridiculous that they made Tamlin immediately completely unlikable. I know we saw hints of his overprotectiveness and that he left her out of planning in the first book, but rather than slowly emphasizing it while still showing Tamlin as a largely positive character before then, his new overprotectiveness and trapping behaviours suddenly take the forefront with no warning, leaving the audience and Feyre to hate him.I found it semi irritating that after she left him, there was no word from him until the end of the story. I see that they were setting up for the reveal but meh. I read these sorts of stories for their angst and I could've used more.I do find Rhys a more interesting character than Tamlin so I was glad to see more of him. I found him endlessly more interesting in the first book, but he was fine here too. He's essentially a blanket statement hero who has almost never done anything wrong but does everything for his city and his friends. I wish he was still a little more morally grey but what can you do.Overall, the action was still decent, the characters were a lot more interesting (Lucian and Rhys were the highlights of the first book, whereas all of Rhys' crew interested me more or less in this one), but Tamlin's sudden villain transformation was done with less care than I'd prefer, and there was a bit more waiting and sap in this one, which isn't my preference but is likely someone else's.I give it a 3/5 on trope-y classic absurdity, not necessarily on it being a great book. It's fine, but mostly I read it for that classic ever-running fanfic pacing and story beats, which it provides on well enough.
