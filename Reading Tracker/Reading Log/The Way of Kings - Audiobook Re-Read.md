Review: I’m really enjoying my re-read so far! I’ve slowed down quite a bit on it and haven’t been listening as much during commutes lately, but I’m hoping to finish soon. I have a bit of fatigue with Way of Kings, so ideally I want to finish it before too long so I can move forward to the books I remember less
