Review: Honestly, I wish this book worked for me. I don't believe it's entirely the book's fault that it didn't — I was in a bit of a reading slump to be sure. Still, I kept waiting for something. While I found the biologist interesting in a character study way, I wasn't always invested in her current motivations. She was honestly more interesting to me in flashbacks than in her actions. I was waiting for more with the surveyor and was disappointed there wasn't more there. Though her end was fitting, I can't help but wonder just how much more psychological unease we could've experienced between the two characters.At the end of the day, I just never fully bought in. I didn't feel the unsettling setting, I didn't feel the allure and fear of the Crawler. Unfortunately, without those thing, I just didn't feel much about the story. It was interesting, and feels like something I should've enjoyed, but I just never felt it, and as such, I can't rate it too highly.
