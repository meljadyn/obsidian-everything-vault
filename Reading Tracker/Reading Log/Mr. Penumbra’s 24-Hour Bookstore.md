Review: Honestly, I read this book because I had a bingo square for magical realism or literary fantasy. Having finished it, I do not think this book would qualify for that purpose. However, it was a charming enough read. I liked the beginning and found the middle alright, and the ending fairly unsatisfying. Unfortunately it just wasn't the book for me, but there was a fun exploration of technology and books and the premise, at first, was fun and interesting
