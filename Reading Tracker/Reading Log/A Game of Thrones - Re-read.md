Review: This review has spoilersThis is a re-read for me, and admittedly that made it a bit less enjoyable. I've seen the first season of Game Of Thrones two or three times, and this is my second or third time reading the book.However, I did enjoy it a lot more than I did on my first read through. The pacing didn't bother me the way it used to, and I enjoyed more of the point of views than I used to. Catelyn's perspective is still my least favourite, but I don't dread it as badly.Overall, it's a great story, and more than that, a fantastic world. You really see almost everyone rise into their own here. Arya growing into a fighter, a capable individual who is more than her gender would typically allow, Robb following his father's footsteps as Lord of Winterfell, Jon Snow finding a place to belong and to protect, Bran in his journey to come to terms with his crippled state and find what he can do—though he's still fresh to that journey. Sansa, slowly realizing that the royal family, decorum, and the court was never as it seemed. Daenerys, growing from a runaway Princess in the shadow of her brother, then Khaleesi, and now a leader in her own right and mother of dragons. It's just amazing stuff seeing all these characters grow and evolve in such a massive way.Overall, I did enjoy this. I'd love to read more, and I will. I've read the second and third books in the past, but I find those ones harder to recall.Game of Thrones was a great story, but exhausting in a way (hence the 4/5 stars). Some chapters grow long and somewhat tedious when their story isn't the one you intended to read. I'd like to continue this series again, but I'll need a break first.'Til the next one.
