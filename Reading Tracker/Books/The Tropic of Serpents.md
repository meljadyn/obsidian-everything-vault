Description: The thrilling adventure of Lady Trent continues in Marie Brennan's Tropic of Serpents . . . Attentive readers of Lady Trent's earlier memoir, A Natural History of Dragons, are already familiar with how a bookish and determined young woman named Isabella first set out on the historic course that would one day lead her to becoming the world's premier dragon naturalist. Now, in this remarkably candid second volume, Lady Trent looks back at the next stage of her illustrious (and occasionally scandalous) career. Three years after her fateful journeys through the forbidding mountains of Vystrana, Mrs. Camherst defies family and convention to embark on an expedition to the war-torn continent of Eriga, home of such exotic draconian species as the grass-dwelling snakes of the savannah, arboreal tree snakes, and, most elusive of all, the legendary swamp-wyrms of the tropics. The expedition is not an easy one. Accompanied by both an old associate and a runaway heiress, Isabella must brave oppressive heat, merciless fevers, palace intrigues, gossip, and other hazards in order to satisfy her boundless fascination with all things draconian, even if it means venturing deep into the forbidden jungle known as the Green Hell . . . where her courage, resourcefulness, and scientific curiosity will be tested as never before.

Review: |-
  I really liked this one. The first one I had some trouble with on first-read, as I went into it with the wrong expectations. (I expected far more dragons and far less interpersonal and political conflicts). 

  I re-read Natural History of Dragons before reading this one (with all the correct expectations!) and enjoyed it much more, and that carried through to here. 

  I enjoyed watching Isabella find herself a bit more here, as she's no longer living in her husband's shadow, for better or for worse. Her relationship with Natalie and with Tom Wilker was lovely to read, even if it wasn't frenetically personal.

  I'm just loving the realism of this series, with how long these expeditions take to plan, with how "little" they seem to get done, and the discovery of local people, cultures, and politics just as much as we learn about dragons.
