Review: |-
  This review has spoilers.

  I took a break from this one about halfway through so I can't fully remember the first few stories. But to my memory, there were a lot of winners. The dragon story was exciting, and the stories in between were good fun. I think this book featured the doppelganger which was a good time if a bit meandering. I really really loved the last two stories—Ciri's introduction and Geralt's journey with the merchant who owed him a debt. Those two stories would nearly be 5 stars.

  I can't truly say where this would be placed since my memory of it is lacking, but the ending was fantastic. It's unfortunate that it couldn't hold my attention consistently so I could give it a proper review.
