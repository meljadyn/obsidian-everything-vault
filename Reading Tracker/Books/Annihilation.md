Description: "A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE FROM ALEX GARLAND, STARRING NATALIE PORTMAN AND OSCAR ISAAC The Southern Reach Trilogy begins with Annihilation, the Nebula Award-winning novel that 'reads as if Verne or Wellsian adventurers exploring a mysterious island had warped through into a Kafkaesque nightmare world (Kim Stanley Robinson). Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide; the third expedition in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In Annihilation, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition. The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself. They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding—but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything."

Review: "  Honestly, I wish this book worked for me. I don't believe it's entirely the book's fault that it didn't — I was in a bit of a reading slump to be sure.  Still, I kept waiting for something. While I found the biologist interesting in a character study way, I wasn't always invested in her current motivations. She was honestly more interesting to me in flashbacks than in her actions.  I was waiting for more with the surveyor and was disappointed there wasn't more there. Though her end was fitting, I can't help but wonder just how much more psychological unease we could've experienced between the two characters.  At the end of the day, I just never fully bought in. I didn't feel the unsettling setting, I didn't feel the allure and fear of the Crawler. Unfortunately, without those thing, I just didn't feel much about the story. It was interesting, and feels like something I should've enjoyed, but I just never felt it, and as such, I can't rate it too highly."
