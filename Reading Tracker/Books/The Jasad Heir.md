Description: "'A remarkable, razor-sharp debut that cuts straight to the heart.'―Chelsea Abdullah, author of The Stardust Thief A fugitive queen strikes a bargain with her greatest enemy that could resurrect her scorched kingdom or leave it in ashes forever in this unmissable, slow-burn, Egyptian-inspired epic fantasy debut. Ten years ago, the kingdom of Jasad burned. Its magic was outlawed. Its royal family murdered. At least, that’s what Sylvia wants people to believe. The Heir of Jasad escaped the massacre, and she intends to stay hidden, especially from the armies of Nizahl that continue to hunt her people. But a moment of anger changes everything. When Arin, the Nizahl Heir, tracks a group of Jasadi rebels to her village, Sylvia accidentally reveals her magic—and captures his attention. Now Sylvia’s forced to make a deal with her greatest enemy: Help him hunt the rebels in exchange for her life. A deadly game begins. Sylvia can’t let Arin discover her identity, even as hatred shifts into something more between the Heirs. And as the tides change around her, Sylvia will have to choose between the life she wants and the one she abandoned. The scorched kingdom is rising, and it needs a queen. Praise for The Jasad Heir: 'Will have you turning pages in a frenzy.' ―Shelley Parker-Chan, author of She Who Became the Sun 'The type of mythological and romantic tale you would bargain your last breath for... A book that coils you into its serpentine grasp.' ―Observer The Scorched Throne The Jasad Heir"

Review: |-
  I'm not sure about my rating for this one. I liked the first half more than the second. I really liked her friendship with her two friends, but unfortunately as the book went on, it felt like we were supposed to believe they were friends despite nearly no meaningful scenes with them aside from necessary plot-scenes. A lot more time went into the relationship between Sylvia and the Heir which I honestly never bought. Their relationship felt very "ooh sexy tropey" from the beginning, by which I mean that scenes that were meant to be terrifying always had a layer of "dominating sexy" to them for some reason.

  I did like some of the world building and ideas here, but the execution fell short for me in the end.

  I also thought there was a bit of dallying in general that could've been cut out in the training chapters underground. Solidly average for me and unfortunately I was looking forward to finishing it.
