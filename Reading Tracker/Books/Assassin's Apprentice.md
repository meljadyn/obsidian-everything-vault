Description: "'Fantasy as it ought to be written . . . Robin Hobb’s books are diamonds in a sea of zircons.'—George R. R. Martin Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal court by his father’s gruff stableman. He is treated as an outcast by all the royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin. For in Fitz’s blood runs the magic Skill—and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the stable hounds and rejected by his family. As barbarous raiders ravage the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne, he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom. Praise for Robin Hobb and Assassin’s Apprentice 'A gleaming debut in the crowded field of epic fantasies . . . a delightful take on the powers and politics behind the throne.'—Publishers Weekly 'This is the kind of book you fall into, and start reading slower as you get to the end, because you don’t want it to be over.'—Steven Brust"

Description: "“An enthralling conclusion to this superb trilogy, displaying an exceptional combination of originality, magic, adventure, character, and drama.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) King Shrewd is dead at the hands of his son Regal. As is Fitz—or so his enemies and friends believe. But with the help of his allies and his beast magic, he emerges from the grave, deeply scarred in body and soul. The kingdom also teeters toward ruin: Regal has plundered and abandoned the capital, while the rightful heir, Prince Verity, is lost to his mad quest—perhaps to death. Only Verity’s return—or the heir his princess carries—can save the Six Duchies. But Fitz will not wait. Driven by loss and bitter memories, he undertakes a quest: to kill Regal. The journey casts him into deep waters, as he discovers wild currents of magic within him—currents that will either drown him or make him something more than he was. Praise for Robin Hobb and Assassin’s Quest “Fantasy as it ought to be written . . . Robin Hobb’s books are diamonds in a sea of zircons.”—George R. R. Martin “Superbly written, wholly satisfying, unforgettable: better than any fantasy trilogy in print—including mine!”—Melanie Rawn"

Notes: I upped this to 3.5 — I love this series and Fitz and I think a lot of my frustration with this story was that I’d already read it. It’s slow and not necessarily a fun read, but I really enjoy it.

  REVIEW AT UNDER HALFWAY MARK:

  Apparently I've read most of this book before a few years ago, but I never finished it and I don't remember it very well, other than the first few chapters being frustrating familiar and not feeling new to me.

  For whatever reason, I just don't find myself wanting to pick this book up. I enjoy it well enough while reading but it has yet to grab me and hold me tight. I find the writing lovely and I enjoy reading the prose, but I think I'm relatively unattached from the characters, which is leaving me without much reason to pick it back up.

  For now, I've decided to pause at about 40% through. I hope I get back into it—I do want to see where the story ends. But Fitz just wasn't grabbing me, as much as I wish he was.


  AND WE CONTINUE:

  I picked this book back up a month or two later and I'm really glad I did. This time it hit a lot better, and I found myself enjoying it a lot more.

  I've always enjoyed the writing style, so it didn't surprise me when I continued to do so. I was viscerally frustrated at Fitz' lack of ability learning the skill after Galen had attacked him. I knew Galen had done something, and it got me so fiercely that I found myself dreaming of solutions and resolutions to figure out what Galen had done.

  Fitz and Verity were a highlight of this book. I feel like Verity really sees Fitz as family in a sense, and feels protective of him. Though we didn't see a whole lot of them together, it was enough to keep me interested. I loved their dynamic.

  Honestly, it was enjoyable. I had started to believe so thoroughly in Fitz's abilities that when he was bested by Regal, and the assassination of the princess's brother followed, I was genuinely in shock. I had thought so highly of him, but at the end of the day he was a boy, and he didn't know everything he was meant to do.

  Fitz and Burrich had a wonderful relationship, by which I mean a complicated, tumultuous, and deeply caring one. When Burrich all but disowned Fitz after realizing he still used the Wit, it stung. Fitz's depression after that, along with everything else in his life, was well-realised. The moment when Burrich realised that Fitz had believed, all those years, that Burrich had called Nosey was devastating.

  Honestly, I enjoyed Fitz's relationship with Chade as well, and certainly with the Fool, and with Molly. Fitz was at his best when he had people, even if it was unfortunately rare for him to be surrounded by people who cared.

  Though at the beginning I struggled to pick this book up, by the end I was eagerly awaiting the next time I could read. It's a 3/5 for me now, but I wouldn't be surprised if it elevates during a re-read. Very enjoyable, and I cannot wait to see what else is around by this author, in this series and in others.
