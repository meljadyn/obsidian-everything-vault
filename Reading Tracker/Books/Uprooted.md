Description: "NEBULA AWARD WINNER • HUGO AWARD FINALIST • “If you want a fantasy with strong characters and brilliantly original variations on ancient stories, try Uprooted!”—Rick Riordan “Breathtaking . . . a tale that is both elegantly grand and earthily humble, familiar as a Grimm fairy tale yet fresh, original, and totally irresistible.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: NPR, BuzzFeed, Tordotcom, BookPage, Library Journal, Publishers Weekly Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood. The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows—everyone knows—that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn’t, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her. But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose. Includes the new bonus short story “The Lake Witch” Praise for Uprooted “Uprooted has leapt forward to claim the title of Best Book I’ve Read Yet This Year. . . . Moving, heartbreaking, and thoroughly satisfying, Uprooted is the fantasy novel I feel I’ve been waiting a lifetime for. Clear your schedule before picking it up, because you won’t want to put it down.”—NPR"

Notes: I dropped the rating on this one to a 1. I literally hated this book, I don’t know why I gave it a 1.5 at time of review. Maybe because I technically finished it? Maybe because the beginning felt like it had potential? I’m not sure. I hated it though

Review: |-
  This review has spoilers

  I read this based on a recommendation online and honestly had a terrible time with this book. I almost DNF'd it, but instead skimmed to the end. Honestly, the concept was cool. I liked the concept of the Woods and the corruption, but honestly the characters were just so dry.

  The main character was an overwhelmingly strong wizard despite a lack of training due to using a specific kind of magic, and honestly was roughly as dull as a rock. Aside from her love for Katsia, there were little real motivations or anything deep that drove her to action.

  While the first few chapters in the tower weren't amazing, I assumed they'd build up to be greater then themselves. Instead we end up dawdling in the court of a nearby city, getting made fun of by some random noble woman while the main character just does nothing useful.

  Soon after, everything goes wrong, corruption is discovered, the army is on the move, the king is dead ... but I just don't care. I can't even fully describe why, but while I did somewhat want to know how the situation resolved, reading about it was like pulling teeth. It was hard to convince myself to continue. It felt dry, dry, dry. I think largely because I didn't care for the main character.

  At the end we got a half baked love story with the Dragon which seems to be 80% magic-lust and 20% "I guess we've been through a lot together".

  Honestly I didn't much enjoy this, and it was hard to get through.

  There were a lot of decent ideas and there was a cool story in there somewhere, but for whatever reason, I could never be made to care.

  tl;dr: The plot could've been good but the characters were dry and boring. I was about as invested as I would've been reading a history book about people I didn't know and had only scarcely heard of. The "romance" was half baked, the penultimate friendship was not explored, and overall it fell short in a number of ways

  1.5/5
