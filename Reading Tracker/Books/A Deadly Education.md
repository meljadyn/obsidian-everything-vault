Description: NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of Uprooted and Spinning Silver comes the first book of the Scholomance trilogy, the story of an unwilling dark sorceress who is destined to rewrite the rules of magic. FINALIST FOR THE LODESTAR AWARD • “The dark school of magic I’ve been waiting for.”—Katherine Arden, author of the Winternight Trilogy I decided that Orion Lake needed to die after the second time he saved my life. Everyone loves Orion Lake. Everyone else, that is. Far as I’m concerned, he can keep his flashy combat magic to himself. I’m not joining his pack of adoring fans. I don’t need help surviving the Scholomance, even if they do. Forget the hordes of monsters and cursed artifacts, I’m probably the most dangerous thing in the place. Just give me a chance and I’ll level mountains and kill untold millions, make myself the dark queen of the world. At least, that’s what the world expects. Most of the other students in here would be delighted if Orion killed me like one more evil thing that’s crawled out of the drains. Sometimes I think they want me to turn into the evil witch they assume I am. The school certainly does. But the Scholomance isn’t getting what it wants from me. And neither is Orion Lake. I may not be anyone’s idea of the shining hero, but I’m going to make it out of this place alive, and I’m not going to slaughter thousands to do it, either. Although I’m giving serious consideration to just one. With flawless mastery, Naomi Novik creates a school bursting with magic like you’ve never seen before, and a heroine for the ages—a character so sharply realized and so richly nuanced that she will live on in hearts and minds for generations to come. The magic of the Scholomance trilogy continues in The Last Graduate and The Golden Enclaves “The can’t-miss fantasy of fall 2020, a brutal coming-of-power story steeped in the aesthetics of dark academia. . . . A Deadly Education will cement Naomi Novik’s place as one of the greatest and most versatile fantasy writers of our time.”—BookPage (starred review) “A must-read . . . Novik puts a refreshingly dark, adult spin on the magical boarding school. . . . Readers will delight in the push-and-pull of El and Orion’s relationship, the fantastically detailed world, the clever magic system, and the matter-of-fact diversity of the student body.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)

Review: Considering my massive distaste from the first Naomi Novik book I've read—and I really did hate Uprooted—this was honestly far beyond my expectations.  Overall, I found the writing style odd and brief, and it definitely seemed to enjoy assuming you knew things you didn't, but that you could infer. While odd, it wasn't bad, and after adjusting to it, its fairly quick and quirky tone really did set the tone for the story.  The characters were okay, with the main character very purposefully prickly, and it was overall a fun tromp in a fairly deadly school, even if deadly sometimes comes across more as mildly inconveniencing.  Normally I write a spoiler filled review, but I don't know if it's necessary here. I liked the book, though it didn't blow my mind. The school feels almost like it's ... badly worldbuilded, not because it's poorly designed, but because it's genuinely and canonically just unfathomable in enough ways that there are always more blank spots.  Overall, an interesting take on the school genre, even though it in places felt rushed and brief. I like the characters but I'm not in love with them, and I liked the worldbuilding and magic, even if I'm not in love with it.  I'm glad I read it, it was enjoyable if not mind bending, and sometimes that's enough.
