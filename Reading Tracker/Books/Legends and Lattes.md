Description: "An Instant New York Times Bestseller A Barnes & Noble Best Book of 2022 A Library Reads Pick An Indie Next Pick A Goodreads Best Fantasy Choice Award Nominee The much-beloved BookTok sensation, Travis Baldree's novel of high fantasy and low stakes. *This new edition includes a very special, never-before-seen bonus story, 'Pages to Fill.'* After a lifetime of bounties and bloodshed, Viv is hanging up her sword for the last time. The battle-weary orc aims to start fresh, opening the first ever coffee shop in the city of Thune. But old and new rivals stand in the way of success — not to mention the fact that no one has the faintest idea what coffee actually is. If Viv wants to put the blade behind her and make her plans a reality, she won't be able to go it alone. But the true rewards of the uncharted path are the travelers you meet along the way. And whether drawn together by ancient magic, flaky pastry, or a freshly brewed cup, they may become partners, family, and something deeper than she ever could have dreamed. “Take a break from epic battles and saving the world. Legends & Lattes is a low-stakes fantasy that delivers exactly what's advertised: a wholesome, cozy novel that feels like a warm hug. This is my new comfort read.”—Genevieve Gornichec, author of The Witch's Heart At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied."

Review: |-
  This was a really great read. Somewhat of a pioneer of low stakes/cozy fantasy in a non-Earth setting, I really enjoyed seeing a new take on fantasy as a genre. It's lovely to enjoy the setting and magic of a fantasy world in a more ... mundane story of you will. It was satisfying and gratifying experiencing every small win and victory as we watch Viv's progress building up her new life.

  A great and quick read overall. While I liked the characters, I didn't fall in love with them, but honestly, I enjoyed the story anyway. It was gratifying, simple, and for me, very quick.

  I typically tend to higher stake fantasy, but honestly, this book is a great breath of fresh air between bigger reads, and I can definitely see the use of a subgenre like this one in the future.
