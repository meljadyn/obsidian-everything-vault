Description: S. A. Chakraborty continues the sweeping adventure begun in The City of Brass—"the best adult fantasy I’ve read since The Name of the Wind" (#1 New York Times bestselling author Sabaa Tahir)—conjuring a world where djinn summon flames with the snap of a finger and waters run deep with old magic; where blood can be dangerous as any spell, and a clever con artist from Cairo will alter the fate of a kingdom. Nahri’s life changed forever the moment she accidentally summoned Dara, a formidable, mysterious djinn, during one of her schemes. Whisked from her home in Cairo, she was thrust into the dazzling royal court of Daevabad—and quickly discovered she would need all her grifter instincts to survive there. Now, with Daevabad entrenched in the dark aftermath of a devastating battle, Nahri must forge a new path for herself. But even as she embraces her heritage and the power it holds, she knows she’s been trapped in a gilded cage, watched by a king who rules from the throne that once belonged to her family—and one misstep will doom her tribe.. Meanwhile, Ali has been exiled for daring to defy his father. Hunted by assassins, adrift on the unforgiving copper sands of his ancestral land, he is forced to rely on the frightening abilities the marid—the unpredictable water spirits—have gifted him. But in doing so, he threatens to unearth a terrible secret his family has long kept buried. And as a new century approaches and the djinn gather within Daevabad's towering brass walls for celebrations, a threat brews unseen in the desolate north. It’s a force that would bring a storm of fire straight to the city’s gates . . . and one that seeks the aid of a warrior trapped between worlds, torn between a violent duty he can never escape and a peace he fears he will never deserve.

  This review has spoilers


  This was a fantastic sequel to all that occurred in the previous story. With only brief introductions to our characters and the set up to the next year's of their life, we move forward five years later, where they have settled into their ways, all in different places.

  Ali has his grove in the desert, Nahri in the heart in the politically unstable djinn city, and Dara under the thumb of the oldest living Bahu Nahida, raised from the dead.

  Watching Dara fall apart was heartbreaking, simultaneously expected and terrible, as he agrees to his new Bahu Nahida's whims and takes on an assault beyond terror.

  Watching Nahri struggle to hold onto herself and protect her city when others are constantly paying for her mistakes, trying to thrive and create a better world, is wonderful.

  Seeing Ali finally come into himself, his powers, and leadership, still struggling to balance his sight of justice as well as his execution in such a politically driven land. Trying to console the parts of him that wished family and loyalty was everything, and the part of him that wished to do better than them. It's amazing.

  That's not even talking about Jamshid and Muntadhir, both characters that grew so much, intertwined in a hidden way, but their stories so so seperate, as Muntadhir finally learns what it is to love his family, to question his father, and his potential responsibility to his land and his wife. Jamshid learning to accept his injuries and serve the kingdom in a way he might not have imagined, with no clue about his Nahid power shimmering beneath the surface.

  Overall, this was a perfect followup, just as politically charged, with the powerful, terrible, and awe-striking assault representing its finale, where Nahri makes a choice that from the outside is counter to her people, her goals, and the city's safety, and from the inside, is a confusing mess of questions, hopes, that honestly, is likely the best chance that Daevabad has to survive this.
