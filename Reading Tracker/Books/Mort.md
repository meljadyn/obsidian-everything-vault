Description: "New York Times bestselling author Terry Pratchett makes Death a central character in Mort, another clever and fabulous installment in the Discworld series, where a cheerfully hapless young man discovers that work can kill your love life when your boss—and your girlfriend’s dad—is the Grim Reaper. Death comes to us all. When he came to Mort, he offered him a job. In the Discworld, the Grim Reaper is a black-robed skeleton with glowing blue eyes and a scythe who’s fond of cats and eternally baffled by humanity. He yearns to experience what humanity really has to offer, but to do so, needs to hire help. As Death’s apprentice, Mort will have free board, use of the company horse, and, best of all, another chance at life, because being dead isn’t compulsory. It’s a dream job—until Mort falls in love with Death’s daughter, Ysabell, and discovers that your boss can be a killer on your love life . . . The Discworld novels can be read in any order but Mort is the first book in the Death series. The collection includes: Mort Reaper Man Soul Music Hogfather Thief of Time"

Description: New York Times bestselling author Terry Pratchett makes Death a central character in Mort, a fabulous installment in Discworld, the fantasy cosmos where even the angel of darkness needs some assistance. Death comes to everyone eventually on Discworld. And now he's come to Mort with an offer the young man can't refuse. (No, literally, can't refuse since being dead isn't exactly compulsory.) Actually, it's a pretty good deal. As Death's apprentice, Mort will have free board and lodging. He'll get use of the company horse. And he won't have to take any time off for family funerals. But despite the obvious perks, young Mort is about to discover that there is a serious downside to working for the Reaper Man . . . because this perfect job can be a killer on one's love life. Terry Pratchett's profoundly irreverent, bestselling novels have garnered him a revered position in the halls of parody next to the likes of Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.

Notes: Bumped up the rating because this book is way better to me than other books I’ve rated 3. I really still like quite a few of the ideas here, and I laughed at lots of the jokes — I just didn’t like the ending very much.

Review: |-
  Mort was a book that I loved and then liked. It begins with interesting characters, interesting settings, and a tone both humorous and whimsical. I laughed out loud several times, which is rare for me. I found the first half was an absolute joy, getting to know Mort, slowly beginning to understand Death, seeing Ankh Morpork.

  As it went on, I felt the characters became less fleshed, and the pace of certain events became a little rushed for my tastes. By the ending, things felt simultaneously resolved and just a bit unsatisfying, as though the true consequences and world was just a touch unresolved.

  Overall though, I loved Mort's beginnings as a boy trying to do right by his father, daydreaming more than he should, and struggling to understand his new job. I loved Death's journey to find happiness. And I was fairly invested in the princess and the wizard, struggling to be recognized.

  The connecting bits didn't particularly resonate with me. By the end I was ready to put it down, but this book has a lot of promise and I look forward to my next read in Discworld.

  Well worth the read, and I'm glad it was my first book in Discworld.
