Description: "When a banished witch falls in love with the legendary trickster Loki, she risks the wrath of the gods in this moving, subversive national bestselling debut novel that reimagines Norse mythology. Angrboda’s story begins where most witches' tales end: with a burning. A punishment from Odin for refusing to provide him with knowledge of the future, the fire leaves Angrboda injured and powerless, and she flees into the farthest reaches of a remote forest. There she is found by a man who reveals himself to be Loki, and her initial distrust of him transforms into a deep and abiding love. Their union produces three unusual children, each with a secret destiny, who Angrboda is keen to raise at the edge of the world, safely hidden from Odin’s all-seeing eye. But as Angrboda slowly recovers her prophetic powers, she learns that her blissful life—and possibly all of existence—is in danger. With help from the fierce huntress Skadi, with whom she shares a growing bond, Angrboda must choose whether she’ll accept the fate that she’s foreseen for her beloved family...or rise to remake their future. From the most ancient of tales this novel forges a story of love, loss, and hope for the modern age."

Review: |-
  I read this book to fulfill a challenge to read a fantasy book based in mythology.

  It's not something I'd typically have read and it surprised me. The story is told mostly in two parts, with a set up and a fall, you could say.

  Though at times I was almost bored, I was also intrigued. I feel like the story will stay with me for a long time coming. There's something about reading about Angrboda, a mother, that was very compelling. Her heartbreak was awful, and her journey afterwards almost unsatisfying in its inability to save herself or her loved ones.

  There was a plainness in this book that made it feel more like myth than a typical story. There was almost a distance between myself and the character that I can't fully describe, though I can't say that it was intentional.

  I liked this story. I felt this story. And I appreciate the ending, which didn't aim to vastly change the original myth, to save those characters we knew and loved. I love that we don't entirely know what happened to them.

  Overall, a compelling way to describe Ragnarok, in the perspective of a heartbroken mother who knew too much.
