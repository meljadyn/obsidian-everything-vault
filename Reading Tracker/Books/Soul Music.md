Description: "'This didn't feel like magic. It felt a lot older than that. It felt like music.' Being sixteen is always difficult, but it's even more so when there's a Death in the family. Susan hasn't exactly had a normal upbringing, with a skeletal grandfather who rides a white horse and wields a scythe. When Death decides he needs a well-earned break, he leaves Susan to take over the family business. The only problem is, everyone mistakes her for the Tooth Fairy . . . Well, not the only problem. There's a new, addictive music in Discworld. It's lawless. It changes people. It's got a beat and you can dance to it. It's called Music With Rocks In. And it won't fade away . . . 'Genius . . . deals with death with startling originality' New York Times 'His spectacular inventiveness makes the Discworld series one of the perennial joys of modern fiction' Mail on Sunday Soul Music is the third book in the Death series, but you can read the Discworld novels in any order."
