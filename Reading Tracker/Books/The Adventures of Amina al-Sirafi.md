Description: "'A thrilling, transportative adventure that is everything promised–Chakraborty's storytelling is fantasy at its best.' -- R.F. Kuang, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel and The Poppy War 'An exhilarating, propulsive adventure, stitched from the threads of real history, Amina’s adventures are the reason to read fantasy.' -- Ava Reid, internationally bestselling author of Juniper & Thorn Shannon Chakraborty, the bestselling author of The City of Brass, spins a new trilogy of magic and mayhem on the high seas in this tale of pirates and sorcerers, forbidden artifacts and ancient mysteries, in one woman’s determined quest to seize a final chance at glory—and write her own legend. Amina al-Sirafi should be content. After a storied and scandalous career as one of the Indian Ocean’s most notorious pirates, she’s survived backstabbing rogues, vengeful merchant princes, several husbands, and one actual demon to retire peacefully with her family to a life of piety, motherhood, and absolutely nothing that hints of the supernatural. But when she’s tracked down by the obscenely wealthy mother of a former crewman, she’s offered a job no bandit could refuse: retrieve her comrade’s kidnapped daughter for a kingly sum. The chance to have one last adventure with her crew, do right by an old friend, and win a fortune that will secure her family’s future forever? It seems like such an obvious choice that it must be God’s will. Yet the deeper Amina dives, the more it becomes alarmingly clear there’s more to this job, and the girl’s disappearance, than she was led to believe. For there’s always risk in wanting to become a legend, to seize one last chance at glory, to savor just a bit more power…and the price might be your very soul."

Review: |-
  For some reason, while reading this book I lost interest at about 35% through and ended up failing to pick it up for over a week.

  I couldn't explain why, since I loved the setting and I loved reading about the protagonist—a former renowned smuggler turned family-driven mother who still had a taste for the sea. I wanted to love it, but for whatever reason I just wasn't picking it up and my library time was ticking.

  I returned it to the library hoping I'd want to pick it up again.

  Not a couple weeks later, I got an opportunity to take it out of the library once again and wow. I'm invested once again.

  I'm not sure what caused my lapse—it may have just been personal stresses—but I'm so glad I picked it back up. They set to sea and have landed on the island they're looking for—and everything is so eerie and unsettling in such a subtle way. Finally we have a reveal of a character I desperately want to know more about and let's just say I wish I could skip work today and keep reading.

  -

  So I finished it. Quickly. It's insane how much this turned around. From the time of my last review, I was just flipping pages until it was over with no reprieve. I was so invested and excited for the grand journey of Amina al-Sirafi and did not disappoint.

  Honestly, it was just fun. Amina al-Sirafi is a mother and an adventurer, once retired but still in love with the see. Reading through her journeys, you can't help but root for her and empathise with her. She's got slippery morals but lines she won't cross. The adventure was fun and palpable, but real, with real stakes and fears, and it was just exciting. I don't know if I'd call this book profound or life-changing, but I will say I just enjoyed it mightily.,I wanted to like it, liked the character idea and setting idea, but couldn’t be absorbed in, and let it lapse at the library.
