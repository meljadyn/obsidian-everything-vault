Description: Claire Randall is leading a double life. She has a husband in one century, and a lover in another... In 1945, Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon—when she innocently touches a boulder in one of the ancient stone circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an 'outlander'—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of our Lord...1743. Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire's destiny in soon inextricably intertwined with Clan MacKenzie and the forbidden Castle Leoch. She is catapulted without warning into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life...and shatter her heart. For here, James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a passion so fierce and a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire...and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.

Notes: I don’t know why I rated this a two — I did like it, and I had a decent time, even despite the fact that I’d already seen the first season of the show. 2.75 feels more appropriate.

Review: |-
  This review has spoilers.

  Altogether better than I had expected. The journey that Claire takes is exciting and startlingly more grounded than I expected. Weather, fever, or a single wolf can become a far larger issue in the end than other books will have you believe, where characters may casually stab a wolf, or ignore the aching pains of long journeys.

  It was a bit high in romance for my tastes, but I did know that going in, and I do have an appreciation for what's there. Overall it was a thrilling journey told slowly and carefully, and Claire, with her love of medicine and botany, makes a great character to follow, with her own ambitions and strengths, and with a perspective that gives us, the modern readers, some space to breathe.

  That said, I think I began to grow weary of Jamie and Claire, which makes sense for me seeing as I am not a romance reader. I loved the chapters where Claire was with Murtagh, and I was fine with the chapters with Jamie and Claire, but I think my interest in that relationship did begin to wane as the story went on.
