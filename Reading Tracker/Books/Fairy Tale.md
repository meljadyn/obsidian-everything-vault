Description: WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE OF HAPPILY EVER AFTER Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But when Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. When Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe - inside the shed is a portal to another world. Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher - for their world or ours.

Review: |-
  This book was fantastic in the first half. Truly. I was excited to see how these characters that I loved would meet with a fantasy world. Turns out, the fantasy world is filled with other characters, that I didn't particularly love, and the story, while definitively fairytale-esque, was unsatisfying and felt prophecy driven and predictable rather than as a result of meaningful and interesting character growth and decision making. It felt a lot like Charlie was dragged through the second half of the story, and while I liked the characters he was with, I never grew to love them.

  The thing is, I think the first half was pretty good. And I think the second half was pretty good. But when you put them together, they give you false expectations of each other. If the beginning of the story has set me up for a Trees of the Emerald Sea-like adventure, with brevity and a fairytale life to it, I may have fallen into the story of the second half with love. Or if the second half had followed the real life tone of the first half, I may have bought the fantasy world. The mix of the two left both halves feeling unsatisfying to me though.

  Ultimately, the beginning gave me a lot of hope as to the kind of story this would be and the way I'd love the chatacters—but I feel my expectations fell short when we hit the fantasy, as it was overall unsatisfying from a story and character perspective. And that's a shame, because as a fantasy reader, I was looking forward to the second half with bated breath. By the time I got there though, I was unfortunately looking forward to the book being over with bated breath instead.
