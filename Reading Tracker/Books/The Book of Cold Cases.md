In 1977, Claire Lake, Oregon, was shaken by the Lady Killer Murders: Two men, seemingly randomly, were murdered with the same gun, with strange notes left behind.

Oregon, 2017. Shea Collins is a receptionist, but by night, she runs a true crime website, the Book of Cold Cases—a passion fueled by the attempted abduction she escaped as a child. When she meets Beth by chance, Shea asks her for an interview. To Shea’s surprise, Beth says yes. They meet regularly at Beth’s mansion, though Shea is never comfortable there. Items move when she’s not looking, and she could swear she’s seen a girl outside the window. The allure of learning the truth about the case from the smart, charming Beth is too much to resist, but even as they grow closer, Shea senses something isn’t right. Is she making friends with a manipulative murderer, or are there other dangers lurking in the darkness of the Greer house?"

Review: |-
  This review has spoilers

  The writing style of this book is simple, one of the simplest I've read in a long time. At first it bothered me, but it quickly faded into the background and almost added to the atmosphere. It felt almost as though I was listening to a podcast, which is where true crime stories flourish these days.

  I never read in this genre and I picked this book up spontaneously. I'm glad I did. It was a great story that I finished in less than two days, and it held my attention all the way through. It isn't a story that I think will stay with me forever, but it was a good one.

  As it went on, I found myself growing tired of the constant flashbacks to Beth. I think the flashbacks were valuable, but overall more was told through them than necessary. I think I would've preferred the mystery of only having key moments shown to us, and the rest being hearsay.

  I really loved the book when it started but got less interested as it went on. Shea's story was my priority, and current-Beth's as well, so all the time we spent looking at her past lost my interest a fair bit.

  That said, I enjoyed this book, and it's certainly better than average. I'd give it a 3.5 perhaps, if halves were an option.
