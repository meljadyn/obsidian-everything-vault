Description: "In this World Fantasy Award-winning novel of magic and kungfu, four siblings battle rival clans for honor and power in an Asia-inspired fantasy metropolis. *Named one of TIME's Top 100 Fantasy Books Of All Time ​* World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, winner Jade is the lifeblood of the island of Kekon. It has been mined, traded, stolen, and killed for -- and for centuries, honorable Green Bone warriors like the Kaul family have used it to enhance their magical abilities and defend the island from foreign invasion. Now, the war is over and a new generation of Kauls vies for control of Kekon's bustling capital city. They care about nothing but protecting their own, cornering the jade market, and defending the districts under their protection. Ancient tradition has little place in this rapidly changing nation. When a powerful new drug emerges that lets anyone -- even foreigners -- wield jade, the simmering tension between the Kauls and the rival Ayt family erupts into open violence. The outcome of this clan war will determine the fate of all Green Bones -- and of Kekon itself. Praise for Jade City: 'An epic drama reminiscent of the best classic Hong Kong gangster films but set in a fantasy metropolis so gritty and well-imagined that you'll forget you're reading a book.' --Ken Liu, Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Award-winning author 'A beautifully realized setting, a great cast of characters, and dramatic action scenes. What a fun, gripping read!' --Ann Leckie, Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning author 'An instantly absorbing tale of blood, honor, family and magic, spiced with unexpectedly tender character beats.' --NPR The Green Bone Saga Jade City Jade War Jade Legacy"

Review: |-
  I’ve written a good amount of my thoughts already in my long-form review as I reading. Overall, I was huge fan of this book. The setting was very unlike most other works that I read, and the concept (very mafia-like) is something that I’m not exposed to very much in my day-to-day. I loved the way that Jade worked, and even more, I loved watching people struggle with it, with powerful withdrawals or even the affects of two much. I like that Jade, despite being this magical, wonderful thing, is essentially a drug, with all the ill-effects you’d expect with it.

  The family was lovely. Hilo is much more complex than I feel you usually see with his archetype, and Lan’s desperation to keep the Kaul family standing, and the struggles he endures even just with the burden of too much Jade, was just wonderful.

  This story came across as one that didn’t pull its punches, for reasons that I can’t fully go into here (as this review is aiming to be mostly non-spoiler. Overall, I loved it. It was a setting I hadn’t been exposed to, with a tight-knit family, high stakes, and slow character-work. Jade City surpassed all of my expectations and more.

  What a wonderful book to get back into reading with.
