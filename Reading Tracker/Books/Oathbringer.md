Description: "The #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Words of Radiance, from epic fantasy author Brandon Sanderson at the top of his game. In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance. Dalinar Kholin’s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified. Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.

Description: "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oa..."

  This review has spoilers


  It feels wrong to give this book 3 stars. Both the previous novels were 5 star reads for me, and this book was in many ways a fantastic follow up.

  This novel followed through on giving me more of the characters I loved, honing in more on their growth, and finally unfolded the great mysteries of Dalinar's past, which was unbelievably exciting and interesting to finally understand and see for ourselves.

  However, it took me a year to finish this book. A full year. This is not entirely the fault of the book — during more than half of this time, I wasn't doing much reading at all. But regardless, I struggled to want to pick this book up, especially during the early chapters in Urithiru. I generally enjoyed what I was reading, though I certainly experienced some political fatigue in some of Dalinar's chapters, but nonetheless it was genuinely difficult to convince myself to pick this book up.

  It's a shame, because I loved so much of it. Almost all of Alethkar's chapters had my attention, as well as Dalinar's flashbacks. I relished in seeing a lot of the characters grow, from Teft, to Shallan and her struggled accepting and controlling her alternate egos, to Kaladin accepting loss, and even to Adolin and his potentially awakened sword, Maya.

  Overall, I had a great time with so much of this book! But my unwillingness to pick it up can mean I can only do 3 stars. I am still an absolute fan of this series, which is epic on a scope I've never truly witnessed before. I hope on a re-read that this story strikes better, but no matter what I'm glad to have read it.
