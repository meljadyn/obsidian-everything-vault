Notes: I actually rated this a 4 right after my last read, as you can see in the reading journal, but when I re-read my review, I realized that may have been a little high. I still enjoyed it though, so 3.5 it is

Review: |-
  I liked it! Unfortunately, there isn't altogether too much that I can say. I really enjoyed watching all the characters interact in this one, and watching them grow together or just exist. I was happy to get to see larger glimpses, though the format is still reminiscent of the short story collections, where there are gaps in time and place between chapters.

  Overall, I liked it. I loved Ciri and everyone she interested with, and I loved Geralt and his interactions with the outside world. I was glad to see Yennifer and watch her and Ciri bond as well.

  I'll definitely be reading on and I look forward to seeing more of this world.
