Description: "Now with over 10 million copies sold, The Mistborn Series has the thrills of a heist story, the twistiness of political intrigue, and the epic scale of a landmark fantasy saga. Once, a hero arose to save the world. He failed. Ever since, the world has been a wasteland of ash and mist controlled by the immortal emperor known as the Lord Ruler. But hope survives. A new uprising is forming, one built around the ultimate caper, the cunning of a brilliant criminal mastermind, and the determination of an unlikely heroine: a street urchin who must learn to master the power of a Mistborn.

Description: "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, the first book in the wildly successful Mistborn trilogy, now in trade paperback. For a thousand years, ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years, the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years, the Lord Ruler reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when all hope was lost, the scarred, heartbroken half-Skaa Kelsier found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, Kelsier recruits the underworld's smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, who each share one of his many powers and relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream: not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers that she’s never dreamed of."

  5% in: 
  I read the prologue and honestly I'm really enjoying it. I loved the characterization and the worldbuilding, and how quickly I was able to catch on and really feel the weariness and resigned nature of the Skaa.<br><br>I'm super excited to continue and I'm glad I picked it up. I hope the excitement continues throughout the whole reading experience. 

  Later:
  I was hesitant to start this book, since I've just finished Six of Crows as a palette cleanser for a larger scope and slower fantasy story.<br><br>To my knowledge, this book (like Six of Crows) is a heist story, and I've never considered myself to be a heist story person in general. <br><br>I've been meaning to read it for a while though, and if how much I enjoyed the Stormlight Archives is any indication, I think I'll love this book. Especially as I know this one to be quicker paced and less massive in scope, because while I love the Stormlight Archives, I also find it as exhausting as it is thrilling.
