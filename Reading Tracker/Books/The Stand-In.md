Description: "Featured in USA Today's 'Best Rom-Coms' of May 2023 and one of the Washington Post's best romances of the year! 'The Stand-In is a charming, engaging rom com that drips in glamour and sparkles with banter. Chu's exploration of multi-racial identity was resonant and nuanced. The Stand-In is truly a stand out romance.' — USA Today bestselling author Andie J. Christopher Gracie Reed was just fired by her overly 'handsy' boss at the worst possible moment. She's been scraping together every extra dollar to get her mother into a top-notch memory care center. To make matters worse, a paparazzo has mistaken her for a famous Chinese actress in town for a new project and the resulting snapshot's gone viral. Gracie's barely holding it all together...until a mysterious SUV rolls up beside her on the street, and she's offered the opportunity of a lifetime. Gracie can't believe what she's hearing: due to their uncanny resemblance, gorgeous actress Wei Fangli wants Gracie to be her stand-in. The catch? Gracie will have to be escorted by Sam Yao, the other half of Chinese cinema's infamous golden couple. Problem is, Sam is the most attractive—and infuriating—man Gracie's ever met. But if it means getting the money she needs for her mother, Gracie's in. Soon Gracie moves into a world of luxury she never knew existed. But resisting her attraction to Sam, and playing the role of an elegant movie star, proves more difficult than she ever imagined—especially when she learns the real reason Fangli so desperately needs to step out of the spotlight. In the end all the effort in the world won't be able to help Gracie keep up this elaborate ruse without losing herself...and her heart. Readers will delight in this glamourous, swoon worthy enemies-to-lovers romance that is as hilarious as it is heart-wrenching."

Notes: I can’t believe I read a book just because it was set in Toronto, but what can you do?

Review: |-
  This review has spoilers

  I'm not going to lie—I read this book because it's set in Toronto. I also recently re-watched Scott Pilgrim for the same reason.

  That said, it's a classic trope-y Wattpad-esque story, and I was looking for easy comfort reads. It was alright. Finished it in about 4 hours. The beginning set it up to be better than it was. Sam did a 180 switch from "can't stand you" to BFFs, with no casual awkward coworker stuff in between.

  The ending felt rushed though resolved. I admittedly hate hate hate the misunderstanding trope. Gracie leaving them completely because she assumes she's being blamed for something she didn't do -- that's stupid. I don't know why she did that.

  Overall, it was fine. Enjoyable enough as a quick read-it-and-forget-it comfort read. I wish there was more of a slow burn development in both Gracie and Sam's relationship, and in Fangli's mental health. I also wish they'd gone more in depth about Gracie's conversation with Sam about her previous Boss. It was oddly built up for something that was explained as "I told Sam what happened". I think hearing the story from her—at least parts of it—would've helped show where she is as a character when processing those sorts of challenges.

  But hey, it took place in Toronto! They mentioned the Danforth, Bloor, the ferry, the CN Tower (never been), and even Kensington Market. And at the end of the day, that's basically why I read it.
