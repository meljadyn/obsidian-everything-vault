Description: An astounding novel of decadence, debauchery, and secrecy from one of Ireland's greatest writers. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Enthralled by his own exquisite portrait, Dorian Gray makes a Faustian bargain to sell his soul in exchange for eternal youth and beauty. Under the influence of Lord Henry Wotton, he is drawn into a corrupt double life, where he is able to indulge his desires while remaining a gentleman in the eyes of polite society. Only Dorian's picture bears the traces of his decadence. A knowing account of a secret life and an analysis of the darker side of late Victorian society. The Picture of Dorian Gray offers a disturbing portrait of an individual coming face to face with the reality of his soul. Shocking in its suggestion of unspeakable sin, this novel was later used as evidence against Wilde when he was tried for indecency in 1895.

Description: The Picture of Dorian Gray [1891] is Oscar Wilde's masterful novel about a beautiful young man who is portrayed by an artist, and whose picture proceeds to age in his place. Led astray by an older friend, Dorian Gray acts upon his desires with no regard for the consequences. Despite this, he always manages to escape unpunished. His painted portrait, however, becomes increasingly distorted; and finally, he can no longer endure it. The dandy novel of dandy novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a story whose main character has come to signify a phenomena far beyond the boundaries of literature. OSCAR WILDE [born 1854 in Dublin, died 1900 in Paris] was an Irish poet, playwright, prose writer and essayist. His significance as a symbol for persecuted homosexuals is immeasurable. Wilde was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with hard labour, his works were boycotted, dramatic productions were shut down, and he was publicly vilified. His most famous prose works include the Faustian novel The Picture of Dorian Gray and the autobiographical book about his trial and imprisonment, De Profundis [1905].

  This review has spoilers.

  This book was interesting for me to say the least. First and foremost, it is my first classic. The difference in writing style compared to what I'm accustomed to definitely impacted my thoughts on it, as I was struggling with the idea of whether I would place this at 3/5 or 4/5.

  The beginning I found relatively interesting, with the introduction of Dorian Grey and Basil. Truthfully at this point, I had no interest in Lord Henry. I found Lord Henry was either a brilliant character or an unbearable one, as he constantly bounced from genuinely wise and thoughtful, to what I could only interpret as trying to say something interesting and quote worthy despite the truth behind his words being rather lackluster.

  I was neutral to the book until the introduction of Sybil Vane at which point I enjoyed it rather thoroughly until the end — excepting chapter 11, which took several days to get through, though that could be just as much because I read it in small sessions and in distracted times as it was because the chapter was actually poorly done. I liked the idea of chapter 11 but for whatever reason I couldn't enjoy it.

  The slow corruption of Dorian Gray was something I did enjoy though, and I like the way he passed in the end as well. The role reversal and the stark lack of beauty, poetry, or preparation really seemed to fit the ending. It was incredibly unsatisfying in the best way.

  Overall I really liked it, though I was also admittedly excited for it to be over as the writing style was somewhat draining to me, probably because I was so out of practice with reading. That said, I think most reading fanatics should read this book at least once I'm very glad I did.
