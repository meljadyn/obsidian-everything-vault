Description: "The first book in a seafaring fantasy trilogy that George R. R. Martin has described as “even better than the Farseer Trilogy—I didn’t think that was possible.” Bingtown is a hub of exotic trade and home to a merchant nobility famed for its liveships—rare vessels carved from wizardwood, which ripens magically into sentient awareness. Now the fortunes of one of Bingtown’s oldest families rest on the newly awakened liveship Vivacia. For Althea Vestrit, the ship is her rightful legacy. For Althea’s young nephew, wrenched from his religious studies and forced to serve aboard the Vivacia, the ship is a life sentence. But the fate of the ship—and the Vestrits—may ultimately lie in the hands of an outsider: the ruthless buccaneer captain Kennit, who plans to seize power over the Pirate Isles by capturing a liveship and bending it to his will. Don’t miss the magic of the Liveship Traders Trilogy: SHIP OF MAGIC • MAD SHIP • SHIP OF DESTINY"

Review: |
  It's getting late, as always when I finish a book.

  But let's just say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and also that it was far more miserable than I expected, and that I really enjoyed it.

  If I had to choose, I have to admit I loved reading about Althea and Brennan. I loved Vivacia but also, her pain and Wintrow's were really just heartbreaking and I was not prepared for it.

  Paragon, I also loved, and I didn't tire of the women holding the Vestrit household together, Ronica and Keffria.

  I actually still don't know how I feel about Kennit. I found his chapters interesting enough, but it's so hard to get a read on him as a character that I don't know at all how I feel about him.

  But ooh, I can't even express what a joy Ophelia was! She got me through the super dark Vivacia moments.

  Now, the dishonourable mentions: I could strangle Kyle and Malta. They're just the absolute worst. Torg sucked, but at least he was just a bully. Kyle sucked in a super human paternal way and I hated him. Malta needs to suck it up and act her age!

  Characters aside (though truthfully, what am I reading a Robin Hobb book for but character?), I am unbelievably interested in the Rain Wild and I would love to know more about their culture, their magics, and their connections to the Bingtown Traders.

  All in all, this book is just so good. Just really good. That said, Robin Hobb books also just really hit my mental health sometimes and this was no exception. Damn, Robin Hobb knows how to make me stressed. Worth it, but damn this woman. I love her. ,I'm pretty tired, but I want to make it clear that I love this book. It might be my favorite book, full stop. I'm simultaneously excited and terrified to read the next two. 

  I just feel for the characters so deeply. There aren't many books where I just want to beg the plot to stop and give my favourite characters exactly what they want, because you really feel their aching tiredness and their real disappointment. Not in a loud over the top tears way, but in a familiar way, in the way that makes you remember what it feels like to carry pain day by day and try to swallow it so it doesn't swallow you. 

  I don't know. I just really love this book.
