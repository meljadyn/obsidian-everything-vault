Description: "Marie Brennan begins a thrilling new fantasy series in A Natural History of Dragons, combining adventure with the inquisitive spirit of the Victorian Age. You, dear reader, continue at your own risk. It is not for the faint of heart—no more so than the study of dragons itself. But such study offers rewards beyond compare: to stand in a dragon's presence, even for the briefest of moments—even at the risk of one's life—is a delight that, once experienced, can never be forgotten. . . . All the world, from Scirland to the farthest reaches of Eriga, know Isabella, Lady Trent, to be the world's preeminent dragon naturalist. She is the remarkable woman who brought the study of dragons out of the misty shadows of myth and misunderstanding into the clear light of modern science. But before she became the illustrious figure we know today, there was a bookish young woman whose passion for learning, natural history, and, yes, dragons defied the stifling conventions of her day. Here at last, in her own words, is the true story of a pioneering spirit who risked her reputation, her prospects, and her fragile flesh and bone to satisfy her scientific curiosity; of how she sought true love and happiness despite her lamentable eccentricities; and of her thrilling expedition to the perilous mountains of Vystrana, where she made the first of many historic discoveries that would change the world forever. 'Saturated with the joy and urgency of discovery and scientific curiosity.' —Publishers Weekly (starred review) on A Natural History of Dragons An NPR Best Book of 2013 The Lady Trent Memoirs 1.

Review: "  I found myself thinking of this book more than I expected and attempted to start its sequel quite recently. Shortly after starting, I decided a re-read was in order.   Honestly, it's a good story, especially if you go in with the right expectations. There's also just something   about the story that makes you look forward to more — Isabella feels incomplete. The narrative voice is so much stronger and more worldly than this version of Isabella, and it leaves you wanting to see the woman she becomes.   Upgraded review from 3.75 to 4.25,I was looking to get into more non-fiction books, rather than just fantasy. I figured this would be a decent start for someone entirely unwilling to read anything but fantasy.  I don't know what to say about this book. I liked it. Almost loved it. There was something immersive about it. It pulled you into the world, where you did want to believe in Lady Trent and her earnest memoir, her references to previous works that no doubt haven't actually been published in our real world.  It was slow and ordinary, and also filled with dragons. It's almost more a story about rising above the station permitted by your sex than it is about dragons themselves — and on that note, I wish we'd learned more of dragons, for I certainly hadn't expected how much politics would be encompassed in this story.   A village they don't get along with, villagers ready to kick them out, religious disputes, their guide and host missing, the smugglers, the boyars. It engaged me, but I feel sorely lacking in the meat of the research, the latter half of which was summarised after the climax of this town conflict.    Also, Jacob's dead. And no, I am not alright with it. It is deeply unsatisfying and I couldn't believe they'd done it. Just as I was preparing for the journeys they would go on, I realised he was never to make it there with her. There was something real about their relationship, something earnest. It definitely feels as though something is missing without him.  I look forward to continuing with this series. I hope to learn more about dragons too as I do."
