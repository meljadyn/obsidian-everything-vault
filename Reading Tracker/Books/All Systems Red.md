Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid—a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.

Review: This book was enjoyable, but not for me. Though I liked reading in Murderbot's perspective, at the end of the day I didn't feel very attached to any of the characters (main character included) and I never ended up caring about the story.  It was an interesting perspective and premise, but it fell very average to me. Not mad that I read it, but definitely not for me in the end.
