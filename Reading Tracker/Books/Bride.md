Description: "#1 Indie Next Pick! A Hall of Fame LibraryReads pick! One of People’s Best Books to Read in February A dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha Werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love, Theoretically and The Love Hypothesis. Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast—again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange—again... Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It’s clear from the way he tracks Misery’s every movement that he doesn’t trust her. If only he knew how right he was…. Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what’s hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory…alone with the wolf."

Notes: This may be a bizarre choice, but I watched a read through on youtube where the conclusion was that it doesn’t take itself too seriously; it’s fun and quick to read and fan-fic-y and it would probably make a great palette cleanser!

Review: |-
  This book was very fun, and I appreciate it for being fun. 

  It felt so much like Wattpad and AO3 and that side of writing that I’m honestly surprised it got published, but pleased! As always with novels like this, I find myself confused by its shorter length, but that’s just because I read doorstoppers when I’m on AO3. 

  Overall it was fun, but the characters themselves were only okay at best, and the stakes were never quite as high as I hoped they’d be. That said, I’ll probably read its sequel when it came out, because this was such a short and fun read that I can’t see why not.

  That all said, the smut can be very detailed. So not easy to recommend.
