Description: "The thrilling first adventure in the classic D&D fantasy series, The Legend of Drizzt—perfect for fans of the tabletop RPG and Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. Discover the origin story of one of the greatest heroes of the Forgotten Realms: drow ranger Drizzt Do’Urden. As the third son of Mother Malice and weaponmaster Zaknafein, Drizzt Do’Urden must be sacrificed to Lolth, the evil Spider Queen, per the traditions of their matriarchal drow society. But with the unexpected death of his older brother, young Drizzt is spared—though still at the mercy of his abusive sisters. As Drizzt grows older, and proves himself to be a formidable warrior at Melee-Magthere Academy, he realizes his idea of good and evil does not match up with those of his fellow drow, who show only cruelty to the other races of the Underdark . . . Can Drizzt stay true to himself in a such an unforgiving, unprincipled world? Drizzt Do’Urden, first introduced in The Icewind Dale Trilogy, quickly became one of the fantasy genre’s standout characters. With Homeland, Salvatore pulls back the curtain to reveal the fascinating tale of how this hero came to be—how this one lone drow walked out of the shadowy depths of the Underdark to leave behind an evil society and a family that wanted him dead. Homeland is the first book in the Dark Elf Trilogy and the Legend of Drizzt series."

  This review has spoilers

  This is my first Drizzt novel and the world building in the Underdark frequently awed me. I loved the setting of this book, and despite the fact that I know Drizzt should irritate me, as he is very much a Mary Sue, skilled at anything he attempts ... he just doesn't.

  I rooted for Drizzt like no other and cheered for him when he faced foes. I was euphoric when Masoj finally fell on the end, and I never would've forgiven R.A. Salvatore if the panther had truly perished.

  However, this book did struggle to hold my attention through the first half, though I have no idea why. And I found the subplot of Zaknefein and Drizzt both assuming the other was evil extremely tiring. The misunderstanding trope is one of the worst, and that holds for father and son just as much as it does for the classic couple's plight.

  Overall, I've rarely rooted for a hero as thoroughly as I did for Drizzt, and the Underdark fascinated me as a setting, despite the fact that I spent the entirely story wishing Drizzt would just leave it, as he's way too good for the place.

  4/5 and a worthwhile read to be sure.
