Review: So first, I really liked the first page. It just felt so carefully honed and very fun, with so much about Kell and magic told simply through this coat. So the book and I started rather well off.  Honestly, I had fun. This book had all the comfort that I miss from YA in my teens, but held my attention in a way that reminded me of being a teenager reading this stories, rather than trying to relive them now and realizing they fall short of my expectations.  Which isn't to say that this story was flawless or perfect or wowed me. Truthfully, Lila felt like the classic tough female heroine that I've read hundreds of times before, and Kell was not too far off the classic all-business caring blank slate.  But honestly, at the end of the day I had fun. I liked them even if I'm not sure why, the premise was interesting and the world building was cool and visual, and I liked it.  I guess that's it—I liked it. It was an enjoyable read and I have no regrets reading it. I liked it.

So first, I really liked the first page. It just felt so carefully honed and very fun, with so much about Kell and magic told simply through this coat. So the book and I started rather well off.

Honestly, I had fun. This book had all the comfort that I miss from YA in my teens, but held my attention in a way that reminded me of being a teenager reading this stories, rather than trying to relive them now and realizing they fall short of my expectations.

Which isn't to say that this story was flawless or perfect or wowed me. Truthfully, Lila felt like the classic tough female heroine that I've read hundreds of times before, and Kell was not too far off the classic all-business caring blank slate.

But honestly, at the end of the day I had fun. I liked them even if I'm not sure why, the premise was interesting and the world building was cool and visual, and I liked it.

I guess that's it—I liked it. It was an enjoyable read and I have no regrets reading it. I liked it.
