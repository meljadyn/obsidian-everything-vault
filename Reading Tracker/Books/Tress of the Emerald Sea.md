Description: "#1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson expands his Cosmere universe shared by The Stormlight Archive and Mistborn with a new standalone novel for everyone who loved The Princess Bride. The only life Tress has known on her island home in an emerald-green ocean has been a simple one, with the simple pleasures of collecting cups brought by sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend Charlie. But when his father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Amid the spore oceans where pirates abound, can Tress leave her simple life behind and make her own place sailing a sea where a single drop of water can mean instant death? Note from Brandon: I started writing this in secret, as a novel just for my wife. She urged me to share it with the world—and alongside three other secret novels, with the support of readers worldwide it grew into the biggest Kickstarter campaign of all time. I’m excited to present this first book to you at last: a different type of Brandon Sanderson story, one I wrote when there were no time constraints, no expectations, and no limits on my imagination. Come be part of the magic."

Review: |-
  I'm going to have to come back to this review in more detail. But I binged this book in less than a day and it's late and I've got to sleep sooner or later.

  This book was the perfect child of the Princess Bride (which Brandon Sanderson states as an inspiration for this novel) and the Hobbit. Which is to say that it's whimsical and lovely and adventurous and classicly fantasy in a way that makes you want to curl up with a tea and just end up absorbed. The sort of story you want to tell again to see someone else's reaction to something timeless.

  I loved it. Something about the tone, the execution, it was just fantastic. I loved all the characters, I loved the spores. The journey was just too good.

  THE REST OF THE REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.

  Honestly, if I had to pick a negative side of this, it would be the end. It was almost too neat of a bow, even though it's an ending perfectly befitting the tone of the novel otherwise.

  Besides that, it was fantastic. A seafaring adventure (the best kind of adventure), a suitable amount of mystery, wonderful characters, a perfectly whimsical narrative voice, and the spores! They were fascinating. The seas and the ways the spores reacted to water, all of them so different—they were a real highlight here. I loved learning more about the spores through Tress.
