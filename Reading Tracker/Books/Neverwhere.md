Description: "“Neil Gaiman is undoubtedly one of the modern masters of fantasy writing....For those who have not read Neverwhere, the new edition is the one to read, and is a fitting introduction to Gaiman’s adult fiction....American readers can experience this spellbinding, magical world the way that Neil Gaiman wanted us to all along.” —Huffington Post The #1 New York Times bestselling author’s ultimate edition of his wildly successful first novel featuring his “preferred text”—and including his special Neverwhere tale, “How the Marquis Got His Coat Back”. Published in 1997, Neil Gaiman’s darkly hypnotic first novel, Neverwhere, heralded the arrival of a major talent and became a touchstone of urban fantasy. It is the story of Richard Mayhew, a young London businessman with a good heart and an ordinary life, which is changed forever when he discovers a girl bleeding on the sidewalk. He stops to help her—an act of kindness that plunges him into a world he never dreamed existed. Slipping through the cracks of reality, Richard lands in Neverwhere—a London of shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, murderers and angels that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth. Neverwhere is home to Door, the mysterious girl Richard helped in the London Above. Here in Neverwhere, Door is a powerful noblewoman who has vowed to find the evil agent of her family’s slaughter and thwart the destruction of this strange underworld kingdom. If Richard is ever to return to his former life and home, he must join Lady Door’s quest to save her world—and may well die trying."

Notes: Dropped the review to 3 because I had a big issue buying-in to the characters on first read, and while the absurdism made up for a lot of that for me, I don’t feel like it’s a 3.5 to me. I wonder if I bumped the review for the books’ reputation.

Review: |-
  This was an odd read for me. I definitely had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I wanted to read another Neil Gaiman book after reading his short story, How The Marquis Got His Coat Back.

  And this was a lot like that—partially because the Marquis himself is from (or in) this story, which was a pleasant surprise.

  I actually really liked the beginning of this book, and I really liked it from a bit past the middle to the end of it, but from about 20% through to 50%, it really wasn't doing much for me. At that point, I just didn't care about Richard, or any of the other chatacters, or what they were doing. I did certainly get the feeling of being a fish out of water, but without a character to anchor to, I didn't enjoy it very much.

  Once it picked back up though, and Richard stopped existing listlessly, and we started to learn what Door was trying to achieve, it was fun and enjoyable and altogether a great read.

  I loved the writing style of this story, and when the story was good, it was great. I wish I could've loved the whole thing, but I'll take what I can get and leave with an overall positive impression.
