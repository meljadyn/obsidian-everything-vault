Description: In this first novel in his epic fantasy masterpiece, Stephen King introduces readers to one of his most enigmatic heroes, Roland of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner, on a spellbinding journey into good and evil, in a desolate world which frighteningly echoes our own. In his first step towards the powerful and mysterious Dark Tower, Roland encounters an alluring woman named Alice, begins a friendship with Jake, a kid from New York, and faces an agonising choice between damnation and salvation as he pursues the Man in Black. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, THE GUNSLINGER leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter. And the Tower is closer...

Description: "Enter once more the world of Roland Deschain—and the world of the Dark Tower...now presented in a stunning graphic novel form that will unlock the doorways to terrifying secrets and bold storytelling as part of the dark fantasy masterwork and magnum opus from #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King. “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” With these unforgettable words, millions of readers were introduced to Stephen King’s iconic character Roland Deschain of Gilead. Roland is the last of his kind, a “gunslinger” charged with protecting whatever goodness and light remains in his world—a world that “moved on,” as they say. In this desolate reality—a dangerous land filled with ancient technology and deadly magic, and yet one that mirrors our own in frightening ways—Roland is on a spellbinding and soul-shattering quest to locate and somehow save the mystical nexus of all worlds, all universes: the Dark Tower. Now, in the graphic novel series Stephen King's The Dark Tower: Beginnings, originally published by Marvel Comics in single-issue form and creatively overseen by Stephen King himself, the full story of Roland's troubled past and coming-of-age is revealed. Sumptuously drawn by Jae Lee and Richard Isanove, plotted by longtime Stephen King expert Robin Furth, and scripted by New York Times bestselling author Peter David, Beginnings is an extraordinary and terrifying journey into Roland’s origins—ultimately serving as the perfect introduction for new readers to Stephen King’s modern literary classic The Dark Tower, while giving longtime fans thrilling adventures merely hinted at in his blockbuster novels. Bringing the dramatic history of Roland into chronological order—as originally published in the novels The Gunslinger and Wizard and Glass—The Gunslinger Born begins with a reckless act of courage that gains Roland his first set of guns and earns him and his friends, Cuthbert Allgood and Alain Johns, a special missio..."

Notes: I rated it 3.75 on my last read, but I think I was being generous based on reputation. Fact of the matter is, while there were some small things I liked, I was pleased when the book was over because I didn’t have to continue reading it.

Review: |-
  This was a strange read for me. It felt like I was simultaneously invested and impatiently awaiting the end of a chapter so I could put it down. I had some issues with the writing style. It often felt like the main actions of the plot were secondary, and if I was paying any less than complete attention, I'd miss the specifics of what happened, as all the specific details of even major events felt buried.

  Still, I liked it. I liked watching the Gunslinger's journey, and watching him interact with all he found on his way. For all the faults I find in the narrative style for my preference, it did well at demonstrating a character that is so singularly focused and almost dry that it's hard for anything else to matter.

  Overall, I enjoyed this book and I'm glad I read it. There was something about the interactions between characters that felt like it should've been bland but was instead fascinating. The world it is building up was surreal and confusing, and you couldn't help but wonder how it came to be this way, and why everyone is the way they are.

  It's rare for a book to edge me nearly into boredom while also grabbing me for investment, but this one managed it. I rarely cared to pick it up, but when I did, I generally enjoyed it.

  I might continue this series one day, or I may not. But I'm not sad to have read this entry.
