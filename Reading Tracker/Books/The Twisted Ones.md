Description: "When a young woman clears out her deceased grandmother’s home in rural North Carolina, she finds long-hidden secrets about a strange colony of beings in the woods in this chilling novel that reads like The Blair Witch Project meets The Andy Griffith Show. When Mouse’s dad asks her to clean out her dead grandmother's house, she says yes. After all, how bad could it be? Answer: pretty bad. Grandma was a hoarder, and her house is stuffed with useless rubbish. That would be horrific enough, but there’s more—Mouse stumbles across her step-grandfather’s journal, which at first seems to be filled with nonsensical rants…until Mouse encounters some of the terrifying things he described for herself. Alone in the woods with her dog, Mouse finds herself face to face with a series of impossible terrors—because sometimes the things that go bump in the night are real, and they’re looking for you. And if she doesn’t face them head on, she might not survive to tell the tale. From Hugo Award–winning author Ursula Vernon, writing as T. Kingfisher, The Twisted Ones is a gripping, terrifying tale bound to keep you up all night—from both fear and anticipation of what happens next."

Notes: I bumped the rating down a few months after reading — it didn’t stick with me as much as I thought it would, and it’s really faded into the background. It was still decent, but I don’t recall the horror lasting, and I’m left with only some fond memories of a floating effigy at a window and a creepy feeling where the house was.

Review: |-
  I liked it overall. Reading it at night, especially the beginning, was incredibly creepy, though maybe not scary. I liked the setting a lot — cleaning up after her grandmother's hoarding in a town she'd only been to as a child.

  Honestly, the part where it lost me was when they were captured and went into the city of the effigies. Though I appreciate the revelations and i actually think the explanation is just fantastic—a weakened magic, dark kingdom that is now just rebuilding itself by copies, slaving endlessly to make more with no more of the original masters—I have to admit, seeing behind the scenes in that city took away a lot of the mystery and tension. The effigies "tumbling" and deliberating, essentially having discussions—I feel it ruined the tension somewhat. That said, the ending was also very good. Anna likely being killed after her betrayal, saving her from suffering, the reveal that the deer effigy was Colgrave, the building of the second effigy—honestly I really liked it. It was a good book that lost me a little near the end but brought me back. It's bizarre because while I hated the mystery being dropped, I also really liked the explanation, and it's really cool looking back.
