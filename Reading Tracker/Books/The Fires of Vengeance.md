Description: In this 'relentlessly gripping, brilliant' epic fantasy (James Islington), an ousted queen must join forces with a young warrior in order to reclaim her throne and save her people. Tau and his Queen, desperate to delay the impending attack on the capital by the indigenous people of Xidda, craft a dangerous plan. If Tau succeeds, the Queen will have the time she needs to assemble her forces and launch an all out assault on her own capital city, where her sister is being propped up as the 'true' Queen of the Omehi. If the city can be taken, if Tsiora can reclaim her throne, and if she can reunite her people then the Omehi have a chance to survive the onslaught. 'This gritty series set in a South African–inspired fantasy world is an intense reading experience, and the second book is just as phenomenal as the first.'—BuzzFeed News 'The Fires of Vengeance is epic fantasy at its finest.'—Winter Is Coming The Books of The Burning Series The Rage of Dragons The Fires of Vengeance The Lord of Demons

Notes: I really liked the first book and would love to read the second. I’m a little worried it’ll get more into the politics, which didn’t interest me as much as the revenge story, but we’ll see
