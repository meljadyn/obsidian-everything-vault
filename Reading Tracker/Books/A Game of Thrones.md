Description: "NOW THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES—THE MASTERPIECE THAT BECAME A CULTURAL PHENOMENON Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys."

Review: This is a re-read for me, and admittedly that made it a bit less enjoyable. I've seen the first season of Game Of Thrones two or three times, and this is my second or third time reading the book.  However, I did enjoy it a lot more than I did on my first read through. The pacing didn't bother me the way it used to, and I enjoyed more of the point of views than I used to. Catelyn's perspective is still my least favourite, but I don't dread it as badly.  Overall, it's a great story, and more than that, a fantastic world. You really see almost everyone rise into their own here. Arya growing into a fighter, a capable individual who is more than her gender would typically allow, Robb following his father's footsteps as Lord of Winterfell, Jon Snow finding a place to belong and to protect, Bran in his journey to come to terms with his crippled state and find what he can do—though he's still fresh to that journey. Sansa, slowly realizing that the royal family, decorum, and the court was never as it seemed. Daenerys, growing from a runaway Princess in the shadow of her brother, then Khaleesi, and now a leader in her own right and mother of dragons. It's just amazing stuff seeing all these characters grow and evolve in such a massive way.  Overall, I did enjoy this. I'd love to read more, and I will. I've read the second and third books in the past, but I find those ones harder to recall.  Game of Thrones was a great story, but exhausting in a way (hence the 4/5 stars). Some chapters grow long and somewhat tedious when their story isn't the one you intended to read. I'd like to continue this series again, but I'll need a break first.

This is a re-read for me, and admittedly that made it a bit less enjoyable. I've seen the first season of Game Of Thrones two or three times, and this is my second or third time reading the book.

However, I did enjoy it a lot more than I did on my first read through. The pacing didn't bother me the way it used to, and I enjoyed more of the point of views than I used to. Catelyn's perspective is still my least favourite, but I don't dread it as badly.

Overall, it's a great story, and more than that, a fantastic world. You really see almost everyone rise into their own here. Arya growing into a fighter, a capable individual who is more than her gender would typically allow, Robb following his father's footsteps as Lord of Winterfell, Jon Snow finding a place to belong and to protect, Bran in his journey to come to terms with his crippled state and find what he can do—though he's still fresh to that journey.

Game of Thrones was a great story, but exhausting in a way (hence the 4/5 stars). Some chapters grow long and somewhat tedious when their story isn't the one you intended to read. I'd like to continue this series again, but I'll need a break first.

'Til the next one.
