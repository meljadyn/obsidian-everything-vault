  I just finished! I'd read the climax a few days ago (which I adored by the way) and they still managed to surprise me by the end, which is a little annoying! I look forward to the next book but probably won't continue until the cover revamp in June. We'll see!

Spoiler Text: The final fight with Hilo, Anden, and Gont was just bonkers. I was glued to my seat and genuinely couldn't decide whether they'd kill Hilo—which is one of the best parts of the story. There's stakes and there has been ever since Kaul Len died. I didn't expect Anden to turn his back on the family the way he did though — I expected his struggle. But didn't see him giving up on Jade before collecting it as an option.  I genuinely do look forward to the next book!
Spoilers: true
