  Upset But In a Good Way

  I am honestly super surprised by this turn of events, and I didn’t see it coming. I feel like I should have or could have seen it coming though which is a fantastic feeling. 

  I’m disappointed by the change in a lot of ways, but I also look forward to seeing how everyone handles it. Check out spoiler section for more.

Spoiler Text: SPOILERS. Please do not read ahead.So. Uh. (Last call for spoilers). I cannot fucking believe they killed Len. I’m losing it here. I loved him and he felt like he was finally growing into himself as pillar! I was so ready to watch as he hardened and made it work, even if it wasn’t in the peaceful manner he wanted to lead with initially. I did not see his death coming, and the fact that it was so avoidable, and honestly so well foreshadowed that he’d been stretching himself dangerously thin, is just tragic. I’m so done over here. At first I was disappointed, because his PoV is one that I love, but I honestly can’t wait to see Hilo pull himself up and try to make this work. Both him and Shae are so disappointed, now working in the opposite roles from the ones they ever wanted. Hilo wanted to be on the streets, and Shae wanted out. It’ll be interesting watching them pull themselves up and do it anyway.
