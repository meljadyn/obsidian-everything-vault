Non-Spoiler Entry Text: I’m actually really enjoying the book! At first I wasn’t sure, and it took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize that their first names were written second, but once I got a sense of the characters, I really loved it.There’s no characters yet that are falling flat for me and I’m super intrigued by the Jade system. Consider me bought in. Grateful for my slow Hogtown shift so I could read during it!Overall I’m enjoying it, though it’s more of a gentle enjoyment than “I can’t stop” enjoyment. I can definitely see myself finishing the series if this keeps up
