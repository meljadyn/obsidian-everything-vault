Non-Spoiler Entry Text: Alright, I’m loving it. I swear it’s even better on the re-read so far. I just love Althea and I swear I feel her pain even more this time when shit happens (see spoiler section for more details). My least favourite PoV is still Kennit which is crazy because it feels like he should be my favourite, but I’m just so intrigued by the Vestrit family and I never want to leave it.I feel for Ronica just as much as I’m angry with her. Her decision makes so much logical sense based on what she knew of Althea, but ultimately she made a mistake that I’m not sure her family will survive.And Kyle. I don’t even want to think about him. The number of times I’ve groaned audibly and had to explain to John that it’s fucking Kyle again is too many times. Perfect antagonist, 10/10. Fucking damnfuck idiot who sucks and knows way less than he thinks he does and no the women aren’t soft they’re just not fucking idiots like you and okay I think I’m done. Also, poor Wintrow. Smol bean deserves better.

  Obsessed | Loving It | Upset But In a Good Way

  Alright, I’m loving it. I swear it’s even better on the re-read so far. I just love Althea and I swear I feel her pain even more this time when shit happens (see spoiler section for more details). My least favourite PoV is still Kennit which is crazy because it feels like he should be my favourite, but I’m just so intrigued by the Vestrit family and I never want to leave it.

  I feel for Ronica just as much as I’m angry with her. Her decision makes so much logical sense based on what she knew of Althea, but ultimately she made a mistake that I’m not sure her family will survive.

  And Kyle. I don’t even want to think about him. The number of times I’ve groaned audibly and had to explain to John that it’s fucking Kyle again is too many times. Perfect antagonist, 10/10. Fucking damnfuck idiot who sucks and knows way less than he thinks he does and no the women aren’t soft they’re just not fucking idiots like you and okay I think I’m done. 

  Also, poor Wintrow. Smol bean deserves better.

Spoiler Text: "It is hard to be Althea, man. Her depression at losing the Vivacia is really well iterated, and you can really feel that desperation and depression and will to change this situation. Knowing what’s going to happen to the Vivacia in this book and how much pain she goes through as a slaveship makes it so much harder, especially knowing that the other Old Trader families would have prevented Althea from losing the ship and Vivacia from becoming a slaveship if they’d even just asked — ugh. It’s a tragedy and it sucks.I’m also enjoying Brashen’s PoV, as always. Just a solid PoV character from someone who’s rightfully cocky about his abilities, but not at all overbearingly so. He really knows how to work well and keep quiet about rumors and complaining, which is nice.I’m looking forward to all the Vestrit PoVs coming up — I have the least memory of Malta’s journey in this book and I’m excited to go back over it, even if she seems to have become pretty spoiled haha. She’s insufferable but at least she’s a child and not a fully grown man, Kyle. "
