Non-Spoiler Entry Text: I haven’t read this book. I bought it a long time ago, enjoyed the prologue, and failed to get into the first chapter. That’s where I stopped. I’ve heard fantastic things about this series and the friendship between Locke and Jean (mostly from Merphy on YouTube), and that’s what convinced me that I had to read this book. I bought the hardcover and I’m really hopeful that this will work for me!I’m doing this read as a buddy-read/bookclub with John and I really hope it goes well!
