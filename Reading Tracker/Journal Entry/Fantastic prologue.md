Non-Spoiler Entry Text: Somehow the prologue was even better than I remembered, and I remembered loving it.Locke was full of live and I loved jumping from the Thiefmakers explanations to seeing Locke’s actions. The characters felt distinct and lively, Locke and the Thiefmaker especially, and I really hope this feeling can carry me through the next few chapters once Locke grows up. I like that the Eyeless Priest is a performer, and I can see Locke loving that life as well.

  Loving It

  Somehow the prologue was even better than I remembered, and I remembered loving it.
  Locke was full of live and I loved jumping from the Thiefmakers explanations to seeing Locke’s actions. The characters felt distinct and lively, Locke and the Thiefmaker especially, and I really hope this feeling can carry me through the next few chapters once Locke grows up. I like that the Eyeless Priest is a performer, and I can see Locke loving that life as well.
Spoilers: false
