Project:
  - "[[Make meljadyn.dev awesome]]"
Details: Coolify sucks and adds extra shit to my docker images that I can’t remove, so get rid of it. I can’t use Calibre Web because of the default Traefic compression line, and despite saying that they offer a raw compose experience, it’s not available unless you link a git repository. Goodbye.
Status: Done
